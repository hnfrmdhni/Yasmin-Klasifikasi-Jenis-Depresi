I feel like if accomplish something it would not even matter because I will die anyway. Nature is cruel. We are forced into this world just to suffer and die. Anything we do does not matter. I think it is so sad. I have become a shut-in and I stopped leaving my house. Nothing gives me happiness anymore and forcing a hobby just does not feel right.

48229,"I have finally been able to see my anxiety and I'm heartbroken For as long as I can remember, I have always suffered from anxiety. Perhaps it runs in my family. Yet I was never able to name it or put a label on it. During COVID, it took a toll on me and the biggest hit was taken by my marriage. For past half year, so much has happened in my life that I feel like I am living someone else's life. The only good thing that has come out of it, is my ability to finally see my anxiety building up and how I channel it. I am so heartbroken to see that I mostly took my anxiety and put it in my marriage. 

Anxiety builds up in me for various reasons. Sometimes, it is related to work, sometimes things not going my way, or sometimes pretty mundane things. It slowly creeps in me and my mood is spoiled. Previously I was never able to tell that anxiety had built up in me. I would only become aware of it when I blew the lid on something. During COVID, the unfortunate victim became my spouse. I also blew up my relationship with my boss during that time. So once I spoiled the mood around me, or picked up a fight, I would see that things are fucked up. I always blamed the spouse, work or boss for the fight or issues, yet the culprit was mostly my anxiety that slowly built up and got channeled where I had hidden resentments.

It is only during past week that I have finally been able to see the pattern and it is startling. I feel so ashamed and resentful. The sad truth is that I don't see any quick remedy for this either. You see, there will always be some dormant resentments inside me. There are issues between me and my spouse, that we cannot agree on. There will always be resentment which I have how I get treated at work or how I handle more work than the others etc. And whenever anxiety builds up, it needs a channel for relief. I'm afraid my mind will always pick these targets over and over.

I have come to this community to ask for your advice, that what I feel is also how you have felt at some time? I want to take this anxiety and channel it for something constructive. I can't change my spouse, I can't get that promotion. But I can always put effort to find a new job, always choose kindness for my spouse instead of turning things to arguments. How does one make this change? How not being able to channel this energy constructively not become an anxiety in itself too? I need some encouragement and guidance. Thanks",Depression

35843,"Can’t stop worrying about severe illness, cancer, surgery, and anesthesia failure - think I’m going to jinx it happening by stopping worrying about it. This is pretty superstitious, but basically it’s the fear of the fact that often things happen when you least expect them, so I’m afraid to stop expecting them to happen in order to control them into not happening.  

The other thing is that if I stop worrying about them, I get comfortable and attached to my lifestyle, and then if something happens, it’s going to be more of a letdown.  This already happened this year.  I got a very small Pilonidal Cyst (now on track to get a minor procedure to remove it), and at first I was devastated - mostly because for a while I had forgotten about the possibility of these things happening, so there was more of a shock value.

52458,"How to get over embarrassment over having an anxiety attack at work? So the other day I had a full blown anxiety attack at work. All of the sudden my heart started racing, my whole body was shaking so bad, I felt like I couldn't breathe, and I was terrified. The fact that this was happening at work made it 1000% worse. I was with a coworker, and had to run to the bathroom for like 10 minutes to try to calm down. I barely calmed down, but went back out to help customers. I was probably obviously shaking like a lunatic, but I did my best to work through it. I was honest with my coworker and told them what was going on.

This is a job that I've been doing on and off for several years. Nothing bad happened, but my life has been chaotic lately and it just snowballed right then and there. How do I get over the embarrassment of this happening not only in front of my coworker but customers too? I still don't know if my coworker told my boss, but if they had, I'm sure my boss would have reached out by now. The last time I had an anxiety attack this bad was about 2.5 years ago. So it's not a common occurrence, but when I go back to work I'm afraid of it happening again, or about repeat customers commenting on it. I just feel so ashamed and like a total loser.

51732,"Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I self-diagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here, and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.

I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic, paranoid, insecure, and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me, I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while, but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.

I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my ""trauma"" is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular, there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did, but they felt really, sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself, and nobody did for me.

This person lashed out at me, calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times, and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and, honestly, that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.

This person wasn't wrong, but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak, because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back, it felt nasty and unwarranted.

Still though, it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends, a few years since those bad exchanges occured, and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life, seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my self-esteem and it still does.

When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like ""I wanna die"" to myself, like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more ""normal"" again though.

Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not, sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered off-topic since I'm undiagnosed. But yeah, I feel really pathetic about this side of myself. Maybe I'm just highly neurotic, I don't know. I just wish I could understand what's wrong with me.",Personality disorder

For the last few nights when I come back, I've noticed a homeless person sleeping between the glass front at the ground floor entrance and the back of the stairwell... This doesn't particularly bother me because I figured he's just sleeping and all the individual apartments have locks on the doors anyway.

I haven't eaten in let's see... about 5 days, oh it's 1am so yeah 5 days. I've got snacks, protein powder, easy meals, whatever, I just don't have any appetite anymore. I don't have the willpower to force myself to do anything now let alone feed myself, I mean I've literally made awesome dinners for my family so many times,  just to not eat any myself. And I have always had these moments of pure self hatred where I don't feel anything aside from depression, honestly for as long as I can remember. I was born like this. And it's progressively been happening more and more often, and it tends to get more severe each time. Now I have reached a point where the depression doesn't even bother me anymore I don't have the urge to fight off the negativity it all feels normal, like I'm meant to feel this way regardless of what I do. My anxiety often fights off the urges to di, fear of nothing happening after death, the question of is it better to be alive and suffer or die and be nothing, you know the usual..

And then when you get busy, uncoordinated state covered mental health facilities on top of it... Well I'm sure a lot of you can relate.. so usually, even when I try my best I am unable to get professional  help for my issues because I am way too broke to afford anything that's not covered by my insurance, and on top of that we moved states and insurance recently.

And I have to say I just do not get it.I have already heard all the you are not letting it work, you are doing this to yourself kind of statements so Ill start by saying I have always tried my absolute hardest to keep an open mind and do the things they say no matter how ridiculous it sounds to me. But I just do not see how its supposed to help people at all. All I have been told to do over and over again is stupid, pointless things like journaling or meditation or mindfulness or breathing exercises and they just do not do anything. They do not make the suicidal thoughts go away, they do not help me out of a depression or make life more tolerable in anyway. I have had all the sessions where they try to unpack and explain the reasons behind some of the things I do and how its linked to specific trauma, but again, that knowledge does not help me at all. It does not fix anything to know where it came from, its not some Hollywood movie where having someone explain your past to you gives you some life changing breakthrough, it means nothing to me.I just do not see what its supposed to be doing for me and I am finding it really hard to believe that it would work for anyone that is not just completely lacking any kind of self-awareness or someone who actually liked talking about their problems as a form of processing them. The medication they give me has not done a fucking thing either.Its not even that therapy is not working for me, but I was hoping that by doing it for a while Id at least be able to understand how its *supposed* to help but I cannot make any sense of it at all. It honestly just feels like a scam to me more and more every time I go, like its just designed to take money from vulnerable people under the false pretence they can actually get better.

I tried bring up what was happening to my dad hoping he would do something but all he did was talk abt how i should not be stressing out about it and it was not my place. He said he watch my sisters more carefully to making sure they are doing all right but it has been months and he has does nothing to support them. He is a great dad is some areas and very supportive but i feel like he is choosing to kind of ignore the situation. My dad sometimes brings ""lady friends"" over.

She told me that she would never tell my dad she is suicidal unless she felt like she was going to commit suicide in the next few days. i tried my best to be there for her and hid my own feelings so that way she had someone to talk to and did not feel like a burden. The next week she told my dad and he did not really take it seriously. he told her that she was stressed out because of school and he used to feel the same way when he was younger. He offered to find her a therapist but it has been months. It worried me because when i realized she had talked to my dad about it, she was thinking abt killing her self.

even before i started questioning if i had bipolar, i knew that i didn’t have the ability to get angry. 
sure, i get irritated- but that’s only at my family members. in public i don’t display or even feel anger. 

maybe it’s because as a girl, any negative or ‘masculine’ emotion is seen as undesirable, but plenty of girls get angry.

Hey r/anxiety, 

I am in a very tough spot rn, i was working towards becoming a teacher for 7 years, started my teaching certification programme (in my country you need to do this), but after 3 weeks I was so anxious of all the people i constantly had to deal with that i started suffering from constant belly pain, diarrhea, insomnia. So after spending 4 weeks on sick leave i decided i want to quit and try to focus on my mental health first and maybe find a small job (like a 10 h job) in order to be slowly introduced into regular work life while getting support from therapy and social services (the 10 h job idea was from my therapist because i havent had a job except for a summer job when i was 18 which was very traumatic because the boss constantly berated me, made fun of me and humiliated me).
I still live with my parents who have financially supported me throughout my studies (tho till i was 25 my health insurance was free and they got tax benefits and child benefits from me still living with them, if i had moved out i would have been entitled to support by them, my divorced father had to pay me 112 € a month for instance) and to them me quitting because i just can't work with children and a ton of colleagues and the constant stress of being judged and evaluated and dealing with maladjusted kids supposedly is understandable. However they demand of me to immediately get a full-time or 30 hour job so i can move out ASAP in potentially a field i have little experience in and they say i shouldnt become unemployed and rely on social services because it would look bad on my CV.
Because i was struggling to find a field that would interest me within a week of deciding to quit teaching and me offering to apply for a 10 h job at a library (smth i wanted to do before but my applications failed sadly) as a transitionary period my mother basically screamed daily at me the last couple days saying i should get a job and gtfo and stop acting like a child when i started crying, shaking and feeling like i was about to throw up. She says she is entitled to her financial support paying off after all this time and that i should get a job like a normal person and support myself. 

As a result of this constant yelling and screaming and ranting i havent been able to sleep for days, i have lost 3 kg of weight, lack any appetite, have to get up every night cus of diarrhea and havent slept more than 3 hours most nights. Yday i proposed the idea with the 10 hour job and my mother reacted as if i was telling her a bad joke and said i should be ashamed for even suggesting such a thing. In her rage she said i should gtfo she doesnt care if it's social housing or a homeless shelter and that she didnt financially support me to become a work-shy leech. So in my panic i phoned a bunch of social services just in case so i would know my options. Today she came in tears to me and said she was just very concerned about my future. Yday I talked to my doctor and my therapist about the potentiality of getting kicked out and they asked if i could go somewhere to get away from this situation so i can recover a bit like i was supposed to during my sick leave, so i decided today to leave for my boyfriend's place who is still a student and also lives with his parents but in a different country (we are in EU so travelling is no problem). I have some money left from my teaching job that i could give them if they ask for it (i was paying my fam 250 € a month from the teacher pay), so i wouldnt be freeloading while i stay there. 
I have been taking Sertraline (Zoloft) for a few weeks now but have had very little success. I have been in therapy since november and been on sick leave since late february. I think if i had stayed i would have become suicidal as i was noticing myself starting to go numb and dissociate whenever i was being yelled at. After explaining my situation to my doctor she said she couldnt let me leave without asking if i have sucidial thoughts because in that case she would have recommended sending me to a clinic.

Some questions are plagueing me now however... am i a coward? Am i doing the right thing? Am i a lazy leech like my parents call me or just too mentally ill to work a proper job for now?

What do you guys think about my situation am i doing the right thing? What should i have done in your opinion? Kind of asking as a reality check",Anxiety

I want to kill myself just as badly, and I no longer have the constraint of being to exhausted to do so.And I mean really, what is the point? I drag myself through days/weeks/months of this until eventually I die? I have felt this way for 17 *years*. The best life has to offer is chucking pills down my throat to give me some false sense that life is not just immeasurable pain. there is nothing in my life to be happy or content about and I am just expected to numb myself into oblivion and pretend its better. I hate it. This is the best life can offer. What a joke",Suicidal

Anyway...so I've been without that kind of social connection for a long time now. Too busy struggling with education and work and health and life in general to engage in hobbies. 

I think I really have no idea what friendship is apart from seeing it on TV or remembering childhood friends. Is it more than spending time together and watching TV or engaging in hobbies together? Am I even capable of friendship?

She lost a close friend to cancer in december, they have spent nearly every day together.

Now shes at home most of her time. Alone. Her loved cat died earlier this year. she says the whole house just feel dead to her and she is so lonley there. But at the same time she doesnt want to be around others. i know that every time i visit her she struggles and is always close to cancel, but knows that she feels a little better afterwards. 
 
she is calling for help -indirectly. i get the calls. she wants back some structure in her days. she wants to help someone by reading books for kids or a women in a wheelchair who is helpless. But she cant bring herself to do it. 
 
I dont want to push her to much. But i also have to strong urge to help her somehow. more than visit her once a week and listen to her. But i dont know how. i cant imagine the situation she is going throuht. i cant relate to that feeling but i want her to get better and be that brave, wise, strong and creative person she was before. she wants help but i dont know how. she cant bring herself and i dont wanna be to pushy.

Seemingly out of nowhere. Sure we have had our ups and downs over the years. Who does not?However, this has completely blindsided me, because I honestly had no idea this was coming. I have spent our life together, always making my decisions for him, so that we could be happy together. From having kids I did not want, to giving up my jobs to stay home with those kids, maintaining a relationship with his toxic mother when he did not have one with her, allowing him to just carte blanche make decisions regarding new pets coming into the home, and on and on and on. I am pushing 40 (which is still young) and I have a 15 year gap in employment, so it does not matter what I can do or have done, job prospects are basically nil for me.My life has not been the easiest, and while in the beginning of this with my husband, I did struggle with adjusting to everything being so far away from imagined. I came to terms and I was by and large happy with what we have and have built over the years. Maybe the issue was I did not express that enough. I do not know. I do know at some point over the last 6 months, hes become uncommunicative and has been dealing with a massive amount of stress/pressure at work. I have done my best to recognize that and I thought giving him space would help him. Clearly I was wrong. My entire world is coming to an end and I really cannot deal with it. Nothing will change for him but everything will be changing for me. I really do not see myself making it to the other side of this. I have already got a plan and all I need to put it in motion. The only thing stopping me is the tiniest glimmer of hope he will come to his senses, as I do not want any of this. I already know that is foolish and I am just wasting time. I really wish I was stronger than this. Again, thanks for reading. Wasting time",Suicidal

My parents want absolutely nothing to do with me, probably because I am a dead beat who cannot get shit done, and when it comes to graded I am like a B student. And then I have like two actual friends, one of which I can barely talk to because her parents strongly dislike me because I would always have to lean on her for support, and she was the only person who could help me while being willing to help me.

There are numerous benefits to self talk, in particular it can decompress mental states and reduce stress. I hope you enjoy! Sometimes, it’s overwhelming to think about all the stressful things. When you let go of them, you can take solace in the fact they remain in a safe space, but no longer occupying headspace. I developed CocoonWeaver because of a dream I had. My dream was about an app that would be intuitive enough to release the many fleeting thoughts that occupy ones mind. Since then, it has been developed in to a working product, and improved with the help of kind feedback from various neurodivergent communities. I would love to take feedback from this community as well, if you have a moment to download the app and share your feedback I would be extremely grateful.

I was recently diagnosed bipolar 1 but am sitting in the tattered remains of my life, wondering how I could have believed what I did.

I first felt symptoms of mania and intense narcissism this summer (I’m 28 yrs old). I had recently gone through a breakup with my partner of 6 years, had fallen in love with my female best friend (first queer experience) and she did not reciprocate my feelings, and my workload had become incredibly overwhelming.

I started losing weight and hair, had a stress rash on my body and was experiencing fluctuating feelings between paranoia to believing the universe was speaking to me directly.

But theres a delusion I am struggling with the most, that has left me feeling horrid and unforgivable. I believed my wonderful boss of 3 years had emotionally abused me, and was the reason I was experiencing mania and psychosis. I believed this so hard I convinced myself and my therapist/psychiatrist I had PTSD, and that my boss and workplace were all to blame. I told so many people this was what happened to me, because I truly believed it. I blocked my boss on everything and didn’t talk to her for 6 months.

This January I finally looked back at the texts that I thought “proved” I was abused, and found nothing but support and concern from a woman who never did anything but treat me with respect.

How the hell does this happen? Has anyone ever experienced anything similar? Honestly I’ve been feeling suicidal since the realization- I got fired from my job for other mistakes I made while manic, but I don’t know how to tell I everyone I talked to that what I believed for the last 6 months was a total lie.

Please help 😣",Bipolar

46453,"Am I bipolar? tldr; got a diagnosis for bipolar as I was incredibly agitated and restless after a bad reaction to some medication and hospitalized as a manic episode. However I didn't feel elated and I was lucid. Is this bipolar or should I get a second opinion. I'm 31 years old and male.

Apologies for the essay.

Basically my story starts when I was very depressed and anxious for most of my adult life, and medication and therapy didn't do anything to really help. I tried Zoloft one day after the recommendation of my Dr. I woke up in the middle of the night all the time in a panic and couldn't think straight and after a week I was so restless I had to go to hospital. The attending Dr at the hospital said that it is a common reaction to medication if you're bipolar, and prescribed me Olanzapine.

After 2 months I hated the medication as it made me so sleepy and gain weight. So I decided to stop as I didn't need this before for 31 years. I was also prescribed Klonopin. I stopped Olanzapine and became very restless but I could deal with it with the Klonopin and I took it for 2 weeks. I remember the first day I stopped and I felt amazing though, like fully focused and full of positive energy to do things. However, one day I forgot to take Klonopin and it was like a switch flicked in my brain. I spent the next month waking up in the middle of the night in panic, feeling super restless in the morning and struggling to focus on anything.

I came off the Klonopin after that bad experience (but slowly tapered, I learned my lesson from the Olanzapine not to come of medication too quickly). I also got some Trazadone for sleep since I couldn't sleep for the whole night and would wake up in a panic and also couldn't get back to sleep despite feeling tired. As time went on, over the course of 3 months, I stopped having the panic attacks in the night, but would wake up super early really restless but exhausted. I also started to have depersonalization and had this spaced out feeling a lot of the time, and I would sort of feel like I was looked at myself in the third person. This carried on and didn't get better with time over the course of a few months.

Around thanksgiving I got really drunk, and after then, the restlessness became unbearable. I was also super emotional and couldn't focus. But I was fully aware of everything, and I didn't do anything reckless, and I didn't feel elated or anything. I basically tried to stick it out but couldn't take it, and went to hospital and they put me in a psychiatric ward as I was so agitated and restless and it was then they told me they thought I was bipolar and put me on Olanzapine again.

I've stuck it out for a few months, and to be fair, after two weeks of taking Olanzapine and Depakote, I started to feel much less restless and I was able to sleep fully. Also, the spaced out feeling subsided and started to feel myself again. However, the medication has left me super sleepy and it's affecting my work. With my psychiatrist's help we're going to lower the medication dose, but after that reduction, I'm feeling a bit spaced out, but less so than I was before. I'm still super sleepy though.

Basically I don't know what the hell is wrong with me and I kind of feel like I've been put in a bipolar box in terms of a diagnosis, but when I look at classic bipolar behavior, I don't really see it in myself? Has anyone else experienced anything like me? Like severe agitation, inability to sleep and depersonalization, but also being lucid, not engaging in reckless behavior and not having an elated mood?

Although I appear quite nonchalant to people (easiest way to hide my anxiety), I have tried eating and vomiting to lose weight but that did not work in the slightest for me, I changed my hair to look better and I plan to get quite a few cosmetic surgeries in the future. In my eyes, I feel like as a Black young adult, no one ever sees me as approachable or relatable. Most first assumptions are that I am the Big, intimidating, rude kid. I did not ask to be me, I did not ask to look like this or be tall or be unattractive. I feel like for every fashion aesthetic I have tried to feel less of an outsider I feel like a poser. Furthermore, I hate my body since my body proportions mean that I cannot fit into a lot of clothes. But there is no one to vent to. I took it upon myself to get a referral to counselling and I am currently on Anti-depressants. And no matter how much my situation improves, I still feel shitty inside. I recently had a whole day where I just cried non-stop and every time I would calm down, the tiniest negative thought would bring me back to crying. Even now, I do not cry i.e. with tears, but I feel like I am breaking down and become restless.I find that I try to relate to fictional characters, music etc. I recently saw Scott Pilgrim V. The World, and I rooted for that lifestyle/aesthetic such as his sarcastic friends and his whole love triangle situation. And I will daydream, wishing that I could have such a life, rather than being bitch of a giant.I feel like no one can accept my vulnerablity. I tried to cut myself to show my classmates so they would leave me alone, but I did not have the courage to and my mum later saw it and made fun of me and compared me to a teen white girl. I want to lose weight so I seem less of a giant. I remember being younger and being seen as cute and that was genuinely one of the best feelings, because of the security I had, the fact that I was allowed to be vulnerable and cared for. But now, I feel like an outsider, an embarrassment. I continue to help myself, because realistically I would be seen as selfish if I killed myself (Also, I would hate for people who give me shit everyday to claim they cared about me and I do not think I should kill myself over other people) but deep down, I feel like this everyday.

Not sure if I can classify it as 'tremors'

Basically, from what I've seen with different kinds of videos regarding tremors, it doesn't look like it.

Let's say I put my hands in the air facing my palm, or just in the bed resting, it doesn't shake or what.

But sometimes, if I look at them long enough, I notice it they slightly move.

Not sure if I'm doing it voluntarily, I'm being anxious, thus, making it move, or maybe because I'm not used to holding that kind of position, it kinda moves because of it?

If anything, I type a lot in a computer. Upon searching, I've seen that they might just been twitching due to fatigue, so maybe that's what it is?

22890,"&amp;#x200B;Hello guys, first of all, sorry in advance for my English, it is not my native language, I am struggling with suicidal thoughts for months now and I need some advice on my problem, any advice on what should I do to cope up with my situation would be appreciated.I come from a middle-class family from a third world country, 1.5 years ago I borrowed some savings money from my family, around $1500 because I was interested in stock markets, and wanted to earn some side money as I was doing my higher education, my parents, especially my dad was checking on updates every month on how the money was doing, he is not tech-savvy so he believes what I tell him, long story short, I was a noob and lost 45% of the money, and I could not tell him that I lost 45% since it was a huge amount for us, so I lied to him and told him that I invested the money in a bucket of stocks, and according to the current prices, the stocks I told him that I have has a value of $5000 (both bad and good luck ig), which I lied and I do not have, the 55% of the money I did not lose, I invested in index funds, he thinks I have $5000 worth of stocks, but reality is far different, and although we are financially well and he would not ask me to withdraw the fictional money he thinks I have, I am scared as shit that he would find out, I cannot tell him the truth that I lost the money 1.5 years ago, as it would break him that I lied to him, I cannot hold the lies anymore too, since every month he ask for updates, it hurts me mentally, I am having suicidal thoughts now, and I cannot take it anymore, I cannot talk about this situtation to anyone, because of guilt and shame so I am posting it here using a throwaway account, any advice on how to deal with it would be appriciated, thankyou.. Feeling suicidal, Please give me some advice",Suicidal

My parents, siblings, friends, parents friends etc. Everyone seems to think that i am smart. but i have almost all my life been a very observant person and so i came up to the conclusion that my mental ability does not stand out from people in my life at all. school mostly bore me and so my grades are pretty mediocre, i have an iq of 110 which is not bad but is not either what people would consider a smart person. but yet, people seem to talk about me as if i were some genius. and i know this post may seem like bragging, its really not. the problem here is that i do not live up to the expections people have of me, i am living in a false bubble of being smart when I am not. and whenever people refer to me as intelligent it feels like a punch straight to my gut as i deep down know I am not. this situation may seem like a small problem, and i know that some people have it far worse than me. but i cannot stop thinking of myself as a pathetic human being that always have fed into this lies of being smart. and its not helping either that all i want is to be intellegent. all i want with my life is to make a difference for other people. but looking at people who have taken the world to where it is now they all share one thing, and that is superior intelligence. the thing i lack and the thing i hate about me the most. i do not know what to do, this whole thing really has taken a hit on my mental and i do not know how to accept it and move on with life. every day seems to be another day marching towards my inevitable death knowing that i do not have what it takes to be remembered by people. in a couple hundred years i will problably be forgotten as some ordinary dude. which is not the type of person i want to be remembered as.

7415,"I have never attempted suicide but over the last few months my life has become so overwhelming that its now a constant thought. My grandfather committed suicide when my mom was 10 years old which affected me in two ways. 1) I actually understand how painful it is for the people you leave behind, that is why I said I have never attempted it even though I have thought about it many many times, and 2) everyone in my family believes its hereditary and gets overly concerned when I am in a mood. It makes it impossible to talk to anyone close to me about my own thoughts of suicide because I feel like they will take it almost too seriously. I know that does not make sense but I actually hate when people feel sorry for me. So I bottle up my depression and lash out at the people I love. In a perverse way I almost wish they all hated me so that it would make it easier to leave them. The logical part of my brain says my life will turn around and the depression will subside - that is just how life is. Its just incredibly painful right now. Before anyone suggests I go see a therapist or get on medication, I have seriously thought about it but unfortunately my depression is currently stemming from the fact that my business failed, I am in a black hole of debt and I cannot afford health insurance. Money troubles - it does not get more cliche than that. I do not care if anyone reads this or responds I just found it incredibly therapeutic to finally vent all of this. This subreddit helped just to see that my situation is not unique and were all humans dealing with our own circumstances. there is probably someone in our life that is going through their own version of hell and well never know about it and there is definitely at least one person in our lives that deeply cares about us whether we recognize it or not.

45800,"I feel ashamed about the dumb stuff I said whilst hypomanic So I am in a hypomanic episode and looking back on the things I said and did, I feel so embarrassed. 
My parents are away so only my maid was there and I still managed to tell her weird secrets and proceeded to show her all my dumb drawings of my imaginary boyfriend as well as showing her all the shows (not really a show but a game that has many stories) that I watch and pointing out which guy I’m in love with. 
I have no clue why I done this! I feel deeply ashamed for doing this and revealing personal secrets. I also yelled at my grandma (she did deserve it but I should have just hanged up the call), complained about my mum and stepdad to my maid, grandpa, grandma and (biological) father. 

I also went and bought lots of random cooking stuff and makeup that doesn’t suit me, so now I have to return it. And I bought 3 bags of cereal. I am not even allowed cereal by mum. No clue why I bought it. So yeah...

P.S. For any people who are going to be like “go get a diagnosis and meds and this wont happen” : I don’t want to right now. I have nothing to gain from **just** getting diagnosed, and while I do want meds one day, I will wait until I have kids, because I don’t want to take pills when I’m pregnant, and apparently withdrawal symptoms are horrible. Also I’m scared of the side effect of gaining weight.

50687,"Does avpd stem from childhood trauma? Hi lovely community! I’m quite new on this forum! And just wondered if the origin of this is similar to what people refer to as an avoidant attachment style in which a lot of sources claim it’s due to neglect from parents in early childhood.

What triggers avpd or what is the kind of trauma that sparks it? From what I’ve read so far it’s not something you are born with but rather develops with age?

My names Nat. I am 16, trans (she/they), and autistic. All of these play a factor into what I feel may be underlying factors playing into my depression and self-sabotaging tendencies. It seems as if every friendship or relationship I have is toxic in some regard, mostly due to my influence. I am horrible at making new friends, so whenever an old friendship has officially concluded I continue to try and call them back to me, so I no longer will bathe in my own desperations and self-loathing ideologies. I beg and make a fool of myself. And the few friendships I have maintained have only been at the expense of others. Even if they say they do not mind caring for me and helping me through these problems, even if they are also there to lend a helping hand, I never feel as though I do enough in return to grasp it and accept it, that is, their love. I make a bigger deal out of problems constantly, and have no reasonable output or control of my emotions. Something as small as someone leaving me on Read can lead me down a dark spiral into depressing thoughts and much darker ideas. I feel I am not one singular person, but many different people trying to take control of a body that refuses to cooperate. The small glimpses of happiness and fulfillment are quickly overshadowed by long, drawn-out periods of mania and depression. I never feel happy with life anymore. Even when I am enjoying life, I always have a feeling in the back of my mind that I could be doing better, that I could be getting more out of life.For example, I started my first job yesterday and I loved it. The people there were really nice and helpful, and despite not wanting to work in Fast Food, I really enjoyed my time at Sonic working there. But last night I had a breakdown because I kept thinking of all the little mistakes I made and how I felt I would stay where I was and continue falling behind my coworkers. I feel as if I do not deserve peoples sympathy and love, but at the same time, crave it more than anything. I am willing to completely change who I am for someone I find admirable. My life at this point has no balance, and the smallest hint of work or anything adult like college and taxes, I shut down and am unable to function like a normal human being. Something as simple as my friend saying Sorry for not texting back, I was at work makes me want to dispose of my phone and hide away in my room from everyone, to shut myself in from the outside world. Because I feel inferior to them, I feel I could somehow be better, even if they and I are on a similar level of ability.

I found my education to be so fulfilling- but now the spark is completely lost.

Ever since starting grad school my anxiety has NEVER been worse. I have always struggled, but not like this. I have panic attacks just from opening up my computer to do work. The thought of opening my email makes my chest hurt. Anxiety is showing up in other areas- I've had panic attacks because I was just convinced I was going to die within the next few days- because I just felt it. I have panic attacks when someone calls me, thinking they are going to tell me there's been some horrible tragedy. I'm convinced I see people with guns pointed toward me and I am going to be a victim of a mass shooting. I know there's something really wrong going on right now,

And I'm so depressed. I have no drive to do things. The fear of consequences is building up my anxiety, but the thought of doing the thing just seems like the most impossible feat.

52107,"Very sudden onset of physical anxiety symptoms? Hi all,

I never struggled with anxiety like this before, when suddenly I had a panic attack for the first time last month - I felt suddenly extremely uncomfortable and ""trapped/unsafe"" in the minutes leading up to it but the whole time I was still thinking rationally. But the physical symptoms were definitely there and since then I've been having these mini bouts of extremely rapid hyperventilation just randomly through the day and tightness/pain in the chest/stomach. 

These originally happened whenever I thought any remotely negative thought at all, but now they're just popping up at random times. Currently I'm sat here with my stomach in knots and feeling like I'm about to cry for absolutely no reason at all. I wouldn't say I'm very worried about anything in particular (just the normal things I've been a little stressed about my whole life, like school) but it's getting really annoying to have these small (or on occasion, full-blown) anxiety attacks nearly every day. 

Again, this is all completely new to me. I'm prone to overstressing or worrying at times but these symptoms don't seem to be completely related to that since they come on so randomly and I feel like they would have popped up sooner during more stressful times in my life?

I rarely clean or organize anything, so there was a lot that needed to be done. Granted, my apartment is 400 square feet so there isn't a lot to clean but it felt really good to have it clean and organized. I still need to clean my desk but I think that's just a lost cause at this point. But the kitchen is spotless and a lot of the clutter has been dealt with.

To preface, I'm 21, got diagnosed with BP1 in November of 2017, have been medicated since February 2018, and started going to a talk therapist last June. 
Despite having experienced detrimental manic episodes within the past year (severing relationships, abruptly quitting a job I needed, etc) I can't help but think that I don't *actually* have bipolar. 
It's probably because the meds are working and helping, but regardless of that fact I can't shake it and start to convince myself that I don't really need them. 
In therapy I've learned a bunch about my habits and childhood issues, but we don't really discuss things through the lens of having bipolar specifically. 

My mind keeps coming to the conclusion that all of my actions in the past have come from a sound mind, and that I'm using mental illness as a scapegoat of some sort.. or something. 

Sorry. This is a rambling post. But does anyone else struggle with this or something similar?

51379,"Boyfriend broke up with me over my AvPD I was already thinking about breaking up with him just because AvPD made it too painful and scary to be in a relationship even when he didn’t necessarily do anything wrong, but it’s still gut-wrenching. I’m not necessarily heartbroken, I just feel like shit because his reasoning boiled down to “I get you have AvPD and you can’t help it, but it’s your fault this isn’t working out”. He was sick of me constantly ghosting him, never directly communicating or confronting him about anything, and he called me childish for being unable to have a difficult conversation like an adult.

I already feel guilty enough about the way AvPD makes me act without someone I thought was understanding telling me exactly all the ways I ruined this for him, all of which just so happen to be things I already constantly worry are reasons people avoid or despise me. In situations like this, people usually say some shit like “it’s not you it’s me” or go easy on you, right?

Not to mention, one of his reasons was that I was ghosting him while I have been in animation crunch on a tight deadline so I genuinely didn’t have the time or energy to even read messages whatsoever let alone respond, which feels like maybe he should’ve been a tiny bit more understanding of, but in terms of the big picture, I guess I understand. 

It still feels like shit though. I’ve never been broken up with before, and even though I wanted out since the week he first confessed to me, I don’t know if I’ll be able to get over this that easy just because he wanted me to know I was the bad boyfriend and everything I was insecure about, I have every right to hate myself for.

EDIT: After I panic-blocked him on all social media, he is now anonymously harassing me on Tumblr to confront me about it and generally being very childish and kinda fucked up and creepy, so. Maybe I dodged a bullet, actually.",Personality disorder

I have started taking sertraline for my boarderline personality disorder, they primarily wanted me taking it because I have manic depression as well and my doctors are concerned about post partum. Well today I had my pre admit for the hospital, I have barely been on these for a week, but they told me that my baby would likely experience withdrawal once born. I am not sure I want to put it through that, but at the same time they are saying that the benefits for my well being outweigh the risk put on my baby. My SO says he supports me on whatever I choose to do and that he thinks it is best if I take them personally because my moods have been so all over. I constantly feel like I am drowning lately, I know it is not just me, it is my family, they are inconsiderate and its getting to me. I really just need some TLC, I need to feel like they care. It does not feel like they do, I am simply here to make everything convenient for them and now I am in a position where they are taking more than I can give. I have had suicidal ideaology for the better part of my life, since I can remember I have romanticized dying. Only because that means the pain would end. I sound dramatic, but I had a very traumatic childhood and I have never had a chance to recover, or the support I need. I am tired though, this new doctor has narrowed it down, he hit the nail on the head with his diagnosis I think, which was boarderline personality disorder, manic depression, anxiety disorder as well as PTSD. Honestly it all makes sense, my moods, my behaviour, everything. Now it is just figuring out how to stop it so I can be the best version of myself for my littles and not fuck them up. So the medication was where he wanted to start, and then he referred me to a few different therapists, one for DBT therapy, and trauma groups, and then just normal therapy.

I was sent to the counselor's office because I looked sad or I was acting sad or I was not participating in class because I was so overwhelmed with my emotions. My father has always been completely distant, shows no emotion except for when he was hitting me. My mother was fucked up on drugs and alcohol and physically and emotionally abused me. Her 2nd and 3rd husbands do not like me either.I developed a bunch of nervous and noticeable tics because I was so sad or sick. When I would get an each ache or strep, I would get punished (month long+ groundings, beatings, name calling)My mother tortured me when I came out to her as gay in 2003. She sent me to multiple doctors and told everybody in our closed-minded, racist, homophobic family that I was gay. She also kicked me out of the house at 17. I ended up leasing a cheap SRO studio in Chicago so I could have a roof over my head. I paid for that rent with my job at Best Buy. I still do not know how I did it, but I didFast forward to 2015. I went through a bad breakup and ended up doing cocaine almost every night on top of my raging alcoholism in order to cope and numb the feelings. 2016 I started doing heroin occasionally\[and now I do it almost every day -- its been like this since September 2020\]Despite all of this, I was still dating because I thought that finding a partner would fix everything.I met the person who I thought would be my partner for life in 2018. Even though he ghosted me on my birthday, then ghosted me again at thanksgiving that same year I still kept coming back. I love him so much, but I do not understand why.At the beginning of the pandemic, he a new condo and I moved in with him. We slept in separate rooms many nights because we both snore so bad.I loved being with him all the time. But the feeling was not mutual.My partner knew about my demons with drugs and depression -- he also had a drug problem about 10 years ago. I admitted to him that I had been doing heroin almost every night in December 2020. I pleaded for him to not leave me over this and that I was going to rehab as soon as my FMLA benefits were active so I could go to rehab. I wanted to be honest and open, and I was.On March 2nd of this year, I told my partner that I would be starting treatment on March 16. I was very proud of myself for doing this. He, however, flipped out on me and told me that I needed to move out. Now I had to drop out of the rehab program so I could find a new apartment and pay for the move. This led me to spending most of my money on heroin.I expressed to my ex back in March that I was very suicidal. He told me I would never be able to live with myself if you did that to me.I still see him a few times a week. Why, though?Anyway all of this has led me to crippling suicidal thoughts for the last couple of months. The only reason I have not done it yet is because my apartment is a mess and I do not want to put the burden of cleaning up on anybody I know.But I guess it does not matter on my end.

Since getting that email, I've never had social anxiety so badly. It feels like I'm one careless comment away from a hospital stay. I dont know who reported me or even why. I suspect everyone but simultaneously feel like it's all in my imagination. I had to leave class today because I felt everybody's eyes on me. It feels like the well is poisoned. I'm not sure exactly what to do at this point.

Having also withdrawn from a practicum program which I was in to become a teacher (withdrew due to receiving abuse from a supervisor; I have no more passion for teaching kids), I started 2020 with the hope that I can find a better career, a full-time 9-5 office job hopefully. Pandemic turned this all around. I only have a part-time job and self-employment gig. A good thing is that the employer likes my work and gives me more hours and responsibilities, but I am unsure if my job field is suitable for me in terms of income and stability. I do not even know the full reality of this job (adult education), since we have not gone back to an in-person setting yet. After I find out more, I can decide to go back to school to get more credentials. I tell myself, ""let us wait until September when we go back in person"" and ""let us wait until I successfully finish this project next year so I can leave a good impression,"" but I am 25, and I just feel so behind. Just so behind because at this age, I have not even decided my career, have no full-time job, and most of all, still live with my family. I feel like an adult baby. Since the job is remote, I am stuck at home most of the time. It is so boring but most of all, it utterly feels suffocating to be at home because I am left with my ruminating thoughts filled with self-resentment. I feel so guilty every time when I do my hobbies. I tell myself, ""A loser like me cannot waste time away enjoying hobbies."" After getting vaccinated, I have been doing day trips to escape the dullness of my home and rumination. However, these day trips are just temporary escapes, and I am back to 0 when I come back home. I desperately want to move out (I can afford a room rent with my income), but I just feel so lifeless insideafraid to try anything new. This is different from how I was last year when I was extremely busy. I have no motivation to do anything. After I finish work, I just lay on my bed and use social media that makes me feel worse. I have no energy to go for a walk, let alone do self-improvement. I tried to do CBT on my own but had no energy to continue. I tried to look for a low-cost counsellor, but counselling did not do miracles for me, and I feel hopeless. I just want to escape, but there is no escape. I feel trapped inside. Any advice on coping with this somehow? I have no outlet to discuss this with anyone, so at least it feels good to write it down here. tl;dr - Stuck at home with self-resentment due to my bleak career options. Still living with my family.

46552,"I feel like things are catching up to me and I am tired I spent the last two years telling myself to not be sad or angry, and telling myself that depressive issues were simply unacceptable and disregarding the patterns because I managed symptoms so well for four years. Got into my dream school after five years, no self-confidence, not solod on resources, too much pressure, depressive cycling, poor performance, got kicked out. Took time off, made a bunch of promises. Three months back in the school (everyone was so happy) and I was kicked out again. 

The depressive episodes and ensuing nastiness fed (feed) off of my extreme guilt and fear from a lack of support structure and having ruined my opportunities already at this age and crashed my big dream.

I was ""discouraged"" from working so I could not always comfortably cover psych and meds. All I wanted was to be free. Any money I receive came with strings attached with the subtext that I would do what 'normal people' do- get a degree to be a valid person with a future (*like your sibling* narrative). 

So I lied about school, lied about my health, trying the same things over because I wanted the help I recieved to be valid and prove myself as ""not problematic"". Then I hid the drop out. I am terrified of the person of influence who I lied to the most. 

I wrote a letter clearly explaining that I am not ""better"" than ""other people"" with mental illnesses and need to reevaluate my choices because continuing to try when I just keep cycling is stupid. 

I did not receive a good response. To me admitting my fear of failure, shame, and poor mental health- a sentence, and $50. No contact for a month. So I know what to expect. 

 I hurt them by lying, since they put in alot of time and money to help me get this far. But they were really calculated and nasty in the past and I don't know if the rug will get pulled from under me by coming clean.

Now I sitting in this place I won't have the money for soon, on a phone that will get shut off, havent seen my psych in two months, trying to imagine a future different from the only one I ever imagined, or not being homeless. I want to freak out, scream, and walk off but I need to get a job, move, and think about a new future. 

All the food I ate didn't make me feel better and frankly I'm more likely to get employed if I look decent so I should cool it there

47808,"I kind of like it? I guess a little backstory for me: I (18) was diagnosed with depression (and ADHD if that’s at all relevant) a year or two back and have been medicated on and off since…

but no matter if i’m medicated or not I can’t help but WANT to sleep all the time. Like I’m not always that tired, but sometimes i’ll get a very slight wave of drowsiness and take that as an opportunity to just cozy up in my bed and lay down. I don’t go on my phone laying in my bed. I just lay there. sometimes I’ll lay there with my eyes closed for a few minutes.. on and off I’ll suddenly feel a little more awake but be too comfortable to want to get up, or feel so slightly tired that I wanna just lay down and ‘fix it’

But I kind of like it? Like I know that if I tell people I want to sleep all day they’ll often just say it’s depression and that I ‘don’t want to exist’ or something like that.. I want to exist.. I just only ever feel so slightly motivated for 2-3hr at a time. and I live with my mother so i don’t have much real reason to get out and do anything because she seems completely fine with supporting me (which I still often feel bad about still depending on her). And small triumphs like doing my laundry or cleaning my room can’t be it. I’m supposed to be an adult. I’m supposed to have a job. I’m supposed to have any kind of relationship with people. I don’t even have my license.

I am now at the point where I have set the date and plan and everything's ready for me to go. I just want to know why it had to be this way. I have been used as an emotional crutch by so many only to be forgotten about when they are out of their darkest times. I have never been anyone's first choice. Even my wife cheated on me after I worked so hard for our life together. Then at the end of my military career thinking I can finally be free to love and support her to the fullest I get hit with the biggest fuck you I ever experienced. I broke down and when I needed support I was told ""I am too busy, maybe later?"" I went on my days mindless and numb. I am so afraid of killing myself that the sole reason why I deployed was to die on the battlefield. I was unlucky and the ambush did not kill me. I think about how my suffering could have easily have ended if I had just peaked up and let them put the bullet in my head. Why have I made it this far? I have talked to my therapist, I have talked to people who ""relate"", but I can tell they do not have the slightest clue. I really wish I could have been dealt better cards in life but I have enough self awareness to understand that is just how life is. I only wanted to be happy and content with a normal life. A small circle of friends or people that I could actually depend on. Instead I am just alone and there is really no signs of turning it around. I have tried my hardest to reach out to others but it is always me who has to go the extra mile to maintain any sort of relationship. I cannot ever get someone to meet me half way. Pretty long rant and I am sure no one will truly ever care. I am just another person. Just a number to the statistic. People around me may grief for a bit because they had the slightest connection to me but will forget about it later because they have their own life to live. And I understand that.

When I was in high school, I was betrayed by friends who I really trusted. I experienced that one of my closest friends got bullied and quit school. I was so afraid, and I tried to befriend students in other classrooms. Therefore, they were my best friends. 

During the field trip, they said that they disliked me and asked me to leave. I was so shocked. I tried to talk with the teacher, but it was meaningless. After that, I was alone, and I spent days in fear. A week later, I was diagnosed with severe depression. I really had tough times. As I tried to commit suicide, I was hospitalized for 2 months.

I believed that the only way to change this situation is going to university. I studied hard and others said my achievement is a miracle.  However, my time stopped in high school. My heart and the way how to treat others are the same as a high school student like the days, I spent the whole night crying. I am good at making good relationships with professors. I treat them politely and as people who I have to learn. Meanwhile, I am not good with friends, because I am so afraid and don't know how to make a good relationship.

I feel as I'm older not a teenager and at parent house (will be for at least 2 more years due to finances and study) perhaps its not right I'm not sure. Even if I had a flat would it be any different. When I have a gf I don't even care about sex but single I just think about it all time it's weird haha.

Tbh when I'm alone I find I just want to fap and think of sex. Maybe having a gf would help that aspect I don't know? Even still I'm just not losing myself I movies and video games proffering to study etc which is fine but should have fun stuff to.

I make music but can't be bothered that either.

I also notice my hair thinning and think about that all the time which gets me down a lot and makes me feel ageing, maybe a root cause of my depression.

Anyway overall its like I can walk about my house fine but as soon as I go into my bedroom my mood drops so low and my room is nice, open, lots of fun things tv, games, music etc.

Maybe at my age bedroom just for sleeping now? But still it is what is why can't I be happy room.

Maybe I just not got a good balance. Due to my crap hair I stopped going out at night or weekends which was fun and common when younger. I just feel ugly, old and depressed to go out now. 

When I used to go out I found that I was happy home in room for few days as no desire to go out. Then go out and repeat.

Now I never go out so could be issue to? So I feel always in my room, balance was better before.

Also not just my hair but I'm older and lost many friends who have moved on married had kids etc so going out is not really a thing anymore anyway.

I'm so lost right now.",Depression

 and in German I've never had any problems with grammar and such and commas and everything just happened by itself and I always wrote a 1 in dictations and now all of a sudden I've made all these grammatical errors that I've made before and still messed them up.
 and I've never had problems remembering things, but now on a ö I can't remember anything anymore.  I forget everything I'm told and I always have to imagine it before I'm told things.

19710,"I am 25 years old. I have struggled with social anxiety, depression, disordered eating and gender dysphoria since I was 13. Twelve years of suffering. This past year-and-a-half the pandemic came along, of course, and destroyed any improvements I might have made prior to it (even if some of those were admittedly a bit of a facade, me convincing myself and others I would improved because ""I am doing this good thing now and I am not doing that bad thing anymore""). The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways; I feel like it is effects for me have been multiple and some of then I am feeling far more now (at the ""end"" of lockdown) than I ever did during the height of lockdown.there is the enforced isolation, which has increased my social anxiety tenfold, to the point where the loosening of restrictions only means I am isolating even more because there is too many people outside and I cannot cope with them seeing me, looking at me, interacting with me, forming an opinion of me - even a split-second, meaningless judgement is terrifying. I know it is irrational, but social anxiety has this way of making the irrational fears so loud and intrusive that they can become self-fulfilling. I can rationally say to myself, ""nobody cares, nobody's looking at you"". Then I take a 5 minute walk to the shop and have a panic attack due to being so overwhelmed with anxiety. Well now everyone is looking at you, because you are staggering around hyperventilating clutching your chest like you are having a heart attack, you dumb shit. Then there is all the time spent alone with my own thoughts, ruminating over every little thing I have ever said and done, punishing myself and berating myself for things I said without thinking back in ""normal"" times when face-to-face social interaction was a daily occurrence so I let my guard and filter down. I do not just mean cringey moments (although I have plenty of those too), but cruel or thoughtless comments and actions which honestly just make me a terrible human being. Then there is the doomscrolling. Literally, on news websites etc. but also figuratively, in my own mind, which was arguably the master of spiralling into negative and pessimistic thoughts about the world long before ""doomscrolling"" was even a term. Thinking about how we got here and where we are headed and how fucked up the world is. Overpopulation and overconsumption and human selfishness and speciesism mean future pandemics and local and global travesties are only going to get more common. This is not the ""end"", it is just the beginning. Climate change is always on my mind, to some degree. I feel helpless and hopeless, I do not believe humanity will change enough or in time to save this planet. I do the things I can, but I am painfully aware I could be doing more and be more of an activist if I was less depressed and self-pitying. I am also painfully aware that I could do everything in my power and it would not scratch the surface, so long as huge money-obsessed corporations continue to because more destruction in a day than I could in a year, even if I did not bother to try at all. My gender dysphoria is worse because I was forced to sit with my thoughts and acknowledge it for what it really is and always has been. Denial is not healthy, but it sure feels better sometimes than admitting an uncomfortable truth to yourself. And once you admit that truth? You have to fight tooth and nail to get the things required to finally feel comfortable in your own damn skin. I am lucky that coming out was relatively safe and painless for me in terms of others' reactions, and I am so grateful for that. But boy is it a lot of work having to repeatedly ""prove"" your identity to strangers, while constantly second-guessing it yourself (hello, imposter syndrome), only to be told everything is a 3 year wait and costs thousands. Fill out this form and take this test and pay for this consultation and even then you are not our ideal candidate, so we will get back to you. it is exhausting and I have so little fight left in me. Giving up means giving up any possibility that I will ever be happy but sometimes I still want to, just because I am tired of it. That last sentence was about my gender dysphoria, sure, but it is also how I feel about life as a whole. Suicide is giving up. A dead person cannot be happy, but they cannot be miserable either. I am also in physical pain that I cannot get looked at by a medical professional because the doctors need photo ID to update my name, which I do not have. My back and knees are a steady 3/10 when busy or distracted. 7/10 when I try to sleep, unless I am blackout drunk. 9/10 if I smoke weed, for some reason. Everyone talks about weed helping with pain, but if I smoke I am damn near calling myself an ambulance just to get high-strength painkillers because my back hurts so much. I feel fairly sure the physical pain is related to a sedentary lifestyle. I sit at work all day, then I sit and watch TV or go to bed early, I do not exercise because I am scared to go outside and besides I have no motivation. It cannot be good for me and I think my body is trying to tell me that. Every time I try to end a post like this I think of something else, another reason I feel so suicidal. Maybe I should focus on the positives? I am young, maybe not in tip-top physical condition but probably fixable to a decent standard of health/comfort with the right treatment and effort. I live in a wealthy country with access to everything I could ever need. I have a job, I am financially independent, I can make rent and pay for food and even luxuries. I have a family who love me (especially my mum, who means everything to me). I could probably be fairly attractive if I worked out and took better care of myself. I am not unintelligent and I have some compassion, so I could probably do things to help people and better the world if I put more effort in. All of these positives just fill me with so much guilt. I do not deserve these benefits or opportunities, they are wasted on me. Focusing on the positives makes me wish someone else could take my place and be in my position and make full use of it, so I could just be dead. I just want to kill myself.

14631,"I am curious if anyone here has experienced a ""fall from grace"" (apologies if this is not the most correct term) specifically you became the best (or highly skilled) at something in your life, but due to whatever circumstance, you are now no longer able to do that thing.A couple examples as it relates to me would be Michael Phelps or Dominique Dawes, olympic athletes who competed at an extremely high level, and basically devoted their entire lives to becoming the best at their chosen thing (or happened to become the best through their drive/passionate). Both of them are no longer able to compete at those levels anymore, and have stated in interviews that they suffer(ed) from deep depression for a multitude of reasons. What I gather one of the largest reasons is, is that they wrapped their entire identities around what they did, yet now that they lead more of a normal (possibly even mundane) life, there is a lost sense of self, and potentially nothing else could ever compare to their accomplishments / life long love / pursuits. I am asking this, as I have lived this life (non-olympic), and have felt the same way as the both of them for many years. The problem is that I have not met anyone else personally who is experienced this (which is why I am asking), and it is just as isolating as the quote ""it is lonely at the top"". What I specifically struggle with now (for many years), is once you have experienced a joy, fulfillment, and/or accomplishment on such a high level, the pursuit of any other endeavor seems almost meaningless. Of course one could hope to strike lightning twice, yet your ""first love"" (ie. the thing that you did), seems to always outweigh what anything else *could* be (at least for me). there is also a potential guilt I subconsciously feel about *truly* choosing to move on to something else. As a side note, I have done deep work with a Therapist regarding this, which has been beneficial to a degree. I appreciate anyone for taking the time to read this, and/or lending your own thoughts and experiences. Thank you. Fall from grace",Depression

I’ve grown up around anxious people- having parents and step parents on anti depressants and with ptsd, so I know how the gist of mental health issues in this caliber (somewhat haha!). I myself have also struggled with mild anxiety or depression in the past, as well as a brief but somewhat severe ED many years ago, but nothing ever officially diagnosed or bad enough to get diagnosed or treated for a part from some counselling. However in the past few months my anxiety have been ramped up to the max, with the feeling of my heart pushing against my chest for the silliest little fears- giving me insomnia or making me feel sick etc. It’s doing as much as I write this.
One thing to note, I have a heart murmur, and occasionally I can notice it, but normally it’s very faint, if really there at all, so I’m assuming it’s got nothing to do with anything? 
I have been feeling kind of lonely lately. For some more recent context, whilst I play online with my old friends and see them and my bf often, I don’t have any really close friends at uni, and have had some fall outs with a Flatmate I share a bathroom with, making me often anxious in my own home.

51396,"Please help me understand what I went through This is going to be lengthy and ahead of time I want to apologize to anyone this might be sensitive to. It involves an affair and I'm struggling to absolve myself for my part in it and have thought often that I might die of a broken heart over this. I'll begin with the story fully and what I need from all of you is help to see similarities in me that'd make me a BPD sufferer or her or what. I am so mentally screwed up over this that it's been hard to move on. I'm almost 3 months no contact as of right now.

The story begins at work. I worked at a rehab facility in a health field. She was at the orientation for our first day and she said later that I'd caught her eye and she'd hoped to talk to me from the very first time she'd seen me. As I began to see her at work she started casually flirting. Once she needed equipment that'd take blood pressure and I said I only had my POX that does HR and SpO2, she replied ""I want everything"" with a look. As we began to really talk she revealed she had a husband even though she wore no wedding ring. I thought she was beautiful and she was very observant. Later, she said that she noticed me looking at her lips one of the first times we'd spoken. It progressed to innocent things like once I'd said me and a coworker missed her while she'd been off for a week or so. She came up to me later in the shift and excitedly and red in the face said ""you missed me?"" When helping a patient up from bed she'd placed her hand firmly over mine as I held onto his walker. Little flirty things like this intrigued me. I know that I should not have proceeded but I could tell that she was unhappy and I did feel like she was truly deserving of more happiness. She was from Moldova and her husband was Russian. They'd been married for I believe 10 years and had a son who was 5 years old. I began to pursue her a little more and wrote lists of things to do nearby that were fun. Although she'd been in the US for 5 years she'd never been to a movie once in that time. I was so sad and just thought this girl needs to experience the lighter side of life. Finally, one day we exchanged Instagram information and soon began talking on there. She wasn't quick to reveal too much about herself but was definitely initiating conversation frequently. As we began talking it progressed relatively quickly, after a month and a half we were meeting for the first time outside of work. It was around this time that she told me prior to meeting me she'd planned to leave her husband and just be ""alone."" I tried inviting her to a movie but she kept insisting that she wanted to come over to my place. When discussing this she was talking about seating and how we wouldn't be doing anything and all of that. I told her the TV was in my room and all I had in there was my bed. She was kind of trying to say that there could be no contact and all of that. Well, within seconds of shutting the door behind her we were making out. For the entire time she was over we made out. She even shook my bedpost when she got into my bed. I know she would have gone all the way if I'd tried. This is when there were things she finally said that shook me a little. She told me she broke up with one guy because he didn't kiss good and stuff like that. She told me eventually that people when she worked at Amazon offered a threesome with her. I have no idea how that conversation even began. She began to sound almost manic with the things she'd say as if I'd freed some mind that was eager to be free. She told me once that she wasn't ready to date older men because she wasn't ready for that. When we ate tacos for the first time she said she was ready to date because I joked that all women like tacos and margs on their dating profiles. She told me there were times she thought she loved her husband. It was largely like a business relationship where they occupied separate parts of the house and just worked together for the practical purposes of a relationship (kids, home, money). She even told me he had cameras inside the house that he'd watch and monitor. As I started to become more attached to her I became more nervous and more fearful. It was at this time she made a reference to the effect of me being her favorite person and something along the lines of she'd let anyone go before letting me go (meaning friends etc.)  The situation to me as it began was that this girl was wonderful and I'd have been a fool to let her life go by without joy and happiness. She truly was to me someone very special. One of the first things she texted me on instagram was that she perceived me to be ""less happy than I appeared"" at work. She just seemed so genuine to me but as time went on I feared that maybe I couldn't trust her. She revealed a lot about her childhood but not much about the emotions she felt. Like, I know she had a tumultuous upbringing. She literally lived in a village with a bed that was above a wooden stove that heated it beneath. I know her dad whipped her and her brother. She was unfairly responsible for a lot as a kid. She also revealed she had a bout of bulimia in high school. She told me they were told more often that they did something wrong rather than be congratulated for good work. She didn't like me complimenting her too much. She would try to change the subject if I'd say much to that effect. She didn't like when I gave her positive reinforcement either. Like, if I said I appreciated something she'd say I was trying to train her. One thing I'd said I appreciate was when she sent photos of home. Like, what she was doing or what her son and her were doing. I just liked feeling as if I was included in her life. I spoiled the hell out of her. I brought her food and everything I could each time we worked together (about once a week). What happened though eventually was we had a night together finally a month or so after our first kiss. I did not perform well. The anxiety of it all and the feeling that I was being told when and if things are going to happen. This wasn't like I'm feeling horny and you are right next to me. This was I'm coming over this day and we're going to get it on. I'm 33 and my sex drive isn't quite that great and add in this whole complicated situation and well, it didn't go well. This was the first time she said ""I love you"" though when we were doing other things in bed together. I became nervous about my failure to perform. I didn't discuss with her the reason or anything regarding it so that was likely my mistake. The next time we saw each other and I said I love you, she said ""can we not say I love you so much."" That shook me because I didn't know what it meant, like holidays? lol I told her to not tell me how to love her and she accepted that although it probably bred contempt. Fast forward a couple weeks and we are in the car after work and I saw her getting close to another coworker at work. This coworker later said he felt ""some vibes"" from her too but once he saw we'd become close he didn't think any more of it. When I saw them two close, I asked her about it. She said ""you doubt my feelings for you?"" She got upset and rightfully so, later that day she was very panicked and called to say that she was shook up by it. Now our birthdays are approaching. I'd thought we'd see each other on my birthday. No we didn't. Then her birthday was the day after mine. Didn't see each other that day either. Then another 5 days or so went by and she didn't come over or anything. Just prior to what happened next she sent me the music video for ""Wicked Game."" Paranoia took over me and I just asked after a day where communication was kind of lacking between us if she was distancing herself. She told me that no she wasn't distancing herself and that a healthy relationship is two people living separately with separate interests and coming together in the middle to share. Then she said at the time that now she felt worse and that I felt better. Two days later and she called to break up with me and said ""love is not enough."" That was the blackest my life has ever seemed. I had never experienced anything like it. Like I was just floating through a sea of nothingness. The very next day she texted to say ""she still thought of me"" and that she was worried. I just told her that I couldn't help her feel better about her decision to break up at that time. Almost a week went by and she called me. I didn't answer because I figured if it were important she would have called again. Curiosity got the better of me a couple days later and I called her back. She answered and we spoke, she said that she had to become ""better at disappointing me."" She told me it would take some time to get back to normal between us but it didn't take long. She revealed that she'd written in the birthday card she got me (but never gave me) that I made her want to have kids again. She later revealed that she feared and projected that I'd be jealous of the time devoted to our children over me. The fantasies continued and she envisioned us growing old together and that we'd ""rest when we were old."" She is a very hard worker. I've never met anyone so goal oriented in my life. She was truly busy and between her husband not helping her, her son, school and work, she was truly doing it all. I can tell that my persistent need for attention probably bothered her but as I became closer I could no longer act cool. After we got ""back together"" she suggested we go to the movies. I was so happy to finally do something with her outside of work or just spending a night together. Some time to finally bond and enjoy ourselves just sounded great to me. I had a great time and I thought she did too. She said before we went into the movie that she was sorry and that she'd ""never forgive herself"" for what she'd done when she broke up with me. She told me when she'd broken up she stowed away everything I'd given her and deleted our conversation on Instagram. She also revealed that it was a time where she considered going to therapy or doing a virtual session. This was I think one of two times she'd ever say she was sorry to me. I don't remember when it was that she'd said this but it was either before this breakup or somewhere else in the middle of all of this but she said ""I need to love you less."" That's not a good thing to hear. This period was probably the best time of our relationship. She even entrusted me to watch her son while she went to an eye appointment. It was moments like these that I needed where I actually felt valuable to her. I didn't think much of myself outside of opportunities like this. A week or so after our night at the movies she came over again to my place. When she came over this time I performed better but still not well enough. I think I went like 5 minutes and then just lost it for whatever reason. I'm not a very experienced guy and I never really talked about it with her because I thought she'd think less of me. A few more weeks go by and she says that she can no longer spend time with me after work. We'd have like twenty minutes between us after a shift and of course I assumed incorrectly it was because of me. I needed reassurance probably a little too often. I don't know if it was the nature of the relationship, the first breakup, or what it was but I felt on edge. She assured me it wasn't because of me that she didn't want to or couldn't stay after work. She said her husband found a (innocent) picture that I'd given her of me. I knew that a lot of what I'd given her was stowed away so I wondered how only this picture was found. He then deduced that I was a person on her instagram from my photo. She warned me to not text her and that she'd contact me. This went on for a little while successfully until one morning I sent her a couple of messages on Instagram. He was actually online on her instagram and saw the messages where I'd said ""I love you."" She didn't contact me the rest of the day so I knew something was wrong. That night I called her and she answered crying. She said that he'd told her she was a bad mother and all sorts of terrible things. He also messaged me the next day saying ""I hear you are very good friends with my wife, I also want to be friends."" I told her about this and she begged me not to reply and to block him. A few hours later, he had blocked me. She told me he'd even planned to send me pregnancy photos of her. It was truly messed up. This whole situation is, I know. When he blocked me, I wondered why. She told me he was viewing the messages over and over. She told me he was planning to tell his parents and that it would be soon discussed within the family. I never heard much about it after that. My paranoia increased. A few weeks went by and we had some intimate encounters but she still wasn't coming over to spend the night at all. I felt maybe that was due to my inability to really perform but I wasn't sure. After her husband found out though understandably there wasn't as much communication between her and I. Now I waited for her to initiate everything. I waited for phone calls. I waited for texts. One day she texted me precisely before I began work and I said it meant a lot that she did that because it was something she used to do. She told me I was trying to ""train her."" We never had real quality time together. Work was really the best thing we had between the two of us. This is where it all began to break. One day I exchanged just a couple texts with her (even though it was against the rules) and I never received a call. I had a spell of emotions come over me and I got upset I said some rough things, nothing too crazy. The next day we spoke and I said asked her if she was happy. She said if she still calls and I still answer that we're happy. She then began dissecting what I was really asking and she came to the conclusion that I was actually saying that I wasn't happy. I felt our communication was so difficult and we hadn't spent any real quality time together by this time since the movies and our one night together. She told me she ""doesn't do reassurance."" She said she'd have to take time to herself and she'd miss me and stuff but she'd not really be speaking to me. The next week or more I just got texts saying things like ""I miss you"", ""can't talk"", ""good morning."" This went on and on for like I said, over a week. I was getting really affected by it. There I was the other man in this whole thing and I'm wondering how important am I? After all, she has a husband and a life outside of our relationship. She was absolutely my primary partner. I finally got upset and sent her a text that was lengthy and said don't contact me I don't know what is going on, I don't have clarity on anything etc. She must have had my phone number blocked because the next morning I received another ""good morning"" message. So I sent another similar message again. This one was delivered because she didn't say anything at all. I'll admit, I wanted her to fight for our relationship. I wanted her to see how difficult this was for me. I understand that I was wreaking havoc on her life to some extent. I was definitely a hindrance to any stability in her life. Well, after nothing came to me within a couple of days I freaked out. I went back on everything I'd said and apologized profusely and went on and on with a whole bunch of texts and calls. Like a whole bunch. I was so fearful and felt like I was digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole that I'd been responsible for. I still felt I was owed some clarity on her stance with her husband and what was happening behind the scenes but I knew that I was screwing up. After all of this she said it was toxic and that I was frightening her. After she said that I lost it. I was supposed to work with her that night and I called off because I couldn't fathom being near her when she'd said I frightened her. Well, that night she was super pissed. She said that I was acting ""like an 18 year old boy not a 33 year old man."" She said there was ""no more us at work, no more spending time together, no more talking"", no more anything. I was shook up by this as I'd been by everything before it. I told her honestly that when I'd called off that my manager knew it was because of some disagreement between her and I. I had known my manager for years and she was a friend, so I didn't think much of it. After she said all of this ""there is no more us"" stuff several more days went by and I decided to resign from the job. She talked to me finally a couple days after the day I resigned. When we spoke she said that her dad never understood her mom and she was fearful because I didn't understand her. At the end of the call I revealed to her that I quit the job. She abruptly hung up on me and later told me that she began to cry after I told her I'd done it because of what she said. She later texted me and said she wanted me to ""let her go."" This where things got really messy. She told me she wanted to ""be single."" I told her I need time to move on. She replied, ""I will not remind you of myself."" I told her she could write a letter if she ever had some clarity on all of this. She replied, ""I will not send a letter, I don't like writing letters."" A few days again went by and I tried reaching out to her. She asked me what I'd done in those few days apart. I told her that I'd done nothing, meaning I hadn't been with anyone else. When we began talking again things got rough, she began trying to lose weight. She asked if it was because I was nervous why I hadn't performed well in bed. I told her that it was but she questioned whether it was her body. She talked about getting breast implants. She told me that the beginning was fantasy and that it'd never be like that again. She once texted me and said that she missed me more than I even knew but that she can't be vulnerable. She said that she needed to learn to love not me. She said so many things during this period that makes me question everything today. I know women can be emotional and I was definitely emotional enough for the both of us but this was next level. After a struggle to see her, she finally said she wanted to see me. When I did I felt just as we always had together. The butterflies and like she was just the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on. She allowed me to touch her intimately when we had this meeting but it was almost the last time she'd allow me to do so. What happened in the weeks following was my job was reinstated because my resignation was never given to anyone above my manager. She didn't forward it so that she could protect my employment in case I changed my mind. When we worked together those next few weeks there was some contentiousness between us. One night she was upset because something regarding her parents' immigration wasn't going well. She did not tell me what it was initially. I always wanted to know what was bothering her and I was sensitive to her moods. My life with her felt so microscopic. Each interaction was magnified. Each gesture became what I'd live with for the next week as we spent time apart. I was often visibly disappointed when she would not share what was going on. She was very good at reading my expressions. She stormed off and when I caught up with her she had her pants hiked up really high near this one male nurse we worked with. I thought something of this because she'd said she did that near me initially when we began our little courtship. Later that night I said I wanted her to be happy. That I wanted to have a ""good time."" She asked what I meant by a ""good time."" I said that I wanted to have fun. That we never had any opportunities to just have fun together. It was soon after that I decided to go back to school to better myself and to impress my gf (I guess). When I did so she took one of the classes with me. So we'd have Monday nights together in class. Our job soon closed because the building it was in was no longer going to be serviced. This left us only with our class together. She would never come over ever again to my place after our argument involving work. I did my best each week to spoil her. I made salmon salad that I kept on ice in the car and we'd eat it after class released. I got her a spa package to enjoy so that she could just a take a minute to relax. I really missed her. I really really really missed her. I needed time with her to really bond. Her life was undoubtedly busy but the lack of quality time we had together came off as disinterest to me. I became so attached but so worried about the previous damaged I'd done that I began to spiral. In the class we had a good time initially. There was even one week where he had cancelled class and we had like an hour and a half together. It was great. I felt just happy to finally have uninterrupted time with her. She asked me during that time jokingly if I had brought the salmon salad again for her. Also, I'd gotten her a whole box of candies that she liked since childhood called ""Bounty."" She asked where they were and why I'd not given them to her. She told me she liked seeing my reaction when I was asked things like this. When I told her I hadn't eaten them because I'd had enough sweets. She asked ""who have you been getting sweets with."" I just said a friend of mine (Will). I felt so awkward because she had not been paying much attention to me prior to this night we had together. Texts were more sporadic and often mine that I sent weren't replied to. We still spoke every day pretty much but there was never much to talk about. I craved shared experiences and a sense of security. I'd done my part to ruin things but it felt like this was all being sabotaged. One day I called her after I got out of a therapy session and asked her ""how do I ask for what I need?"" I was being starved. I felt overwhelmed by how much I felt I was being ignored. However, I do know during this time she wasn't caring for herself much either. She was irritated when I asked this of her. One night near the very end I offered her a BetterHelp therapy membership. I told her it was the best thing that I could give her. I had already tried brightening her spirits with the spa gift and the other little things I'd tried to do. She said she didn't want to go and that only she could decide when it was necessary to go. She told me she didn't like how I was trying to change her. Another week near the end, I sat next to her in class like always. After class she asked me why my legs were so far from her legs beneath the table. I certainly felt the push/pull behavior. I know she had a lot on her plate but I was single, I didn't have all of these responsibilities and dramas. I was focused on her. A little too much maybe. I didn't know if she'd done this before?? Why the cameras in the house?? Why the invitation of a threesome?? I didn't know if I was really important. My mind raced and raced. One of the final days we had I asked her in a text ""if I ask to spend more time with her, isn't that something she'd want to do because she loves me."" The next day we spoke on the phone and I asked her to reply to that when she could, she said that I can't ask someone to do that. She'd reply when/if she was ready to do so. I was struggling so much, I have thought at times I might die of a broken heart over this. What finally happened was her son was sick, she told me the day before we had class together that she needed a break and requested that I don't text her. I agreed and the next day we saw each other in class. I broke. I asked her if she'd have any time for us after class, she just shook her head no. I snapped. I began just staring at her, intermittently for a good ten minutes or so. Sulking in the chair next to her, I was probably a real sorry sight to see. She looked to me and said ""we'll talk after class."" I made some passive aggressive remarks about borrowing a pen and stuff but nothing too bad. When we got out of class I was immediately upset. She patronizingly said ""let's have a discussion."" As if I hadn't been trying to have one all along about my needs. I said ""did you talk to your husband today?"" She said, ""I have to, he has my son."" I replied ""well nothing for me then, huh?"" The ""let's have a discussion"" remark made me begin to crack a smile (she did not like that) because I just thought to myself how ridiculous is all of this. I love her, I still do. How on earth could she not see how ridiculous it had all become and how it practically was from the start. The argument went mostly like that for just another minute or so before she began walking away. I followed and she said ""I don't like the way you love. Your love is overwhelming."" She got in the car and as I tried to offer her a water I had brought for her, she said ""I don't want anything from you anymore."" She had headaches a lot and one night she drank and ate the ice from the salmon salad on her way home, that's why I had brought the water for her. She went home and I went to meet up with my one friend. I called her and left a voicemail that said something like ""I wish you the best in all the things you have going on. I hope you learn to love and accept love."" The next day I hadn't yet heard from her and I texted her. When I did she told me that maybe a business relationship is what she needs. She can't handle arguments in love. She told me she went home had a few drinks and considered her husband's proposal to get back together. By that she meant they had sex. She told me that what we had wasn't special, that ""it was in my head."" One thing she asked was why I smiled. I said, ""I couldn't believe I was being treated like this."" She replied, ""you're saying I'm a bad partner."" I said, ""I've been asking you for weeks to see you."" I just couldn't believe the whole thing. She acts concerned about such a thing after admitting to having sex with her husband. Her mind truly was chaotic. Where was she when I was breaking at the seams over our lack of time together. We have not communicated at all since that night. The last thing I sent was one heart emoji. I had no words from her to say anything about what I meant. Nothing. I have cried so much over the last few months. I think often about the day that I die and if I might be able to call her and see her one last time so that we might be able to imagine what it might have been if we'd had a chance. A real chance. I don't know. I blame myself. I know that I might have a problem. Maybe we both have a problem. I don't know anything anymore. It was real to me. Maybe I was just being used? If I could go back I would have stopped it from progressing as far as it did. I felt my confidence and my security change once it advanced. I don't know what does this mean to you guys on here? I've read a lot of BPD, NARC stuff. Youtube, Reddit, you name it. Do I have a problem? Is how I acted, aside from beginning this affair in the first place, that outlandish? Why didn't she understand how I might feel being in my position? Was this just a natural breakdown of an affair? Did I really mean nothing? How do I move on from this? How was this a genuine relationship with none of the healthy aspects a relationship has. Is it because she has a different outlook on love culturally? Is it because she sabotages relationships. I can't see how any intimate relationship with her could succeed, there doesn't seem to be any consistency. I am so confused. Thank you to anyone who reads and dissects this whole thing.

I have managed it all this time with no medicine, and I have been fine with for the most part. The only time my anxiety would rise a little bit is when it was triggered by stress. Which then I knew I just had to balance it out again.

Well, this month ended up with heighten anxiety due to an allergic reaction being around seafood, one week later got a tooth pulled, 2 days later I was fussed at by an ER doctor, and then one week later after that I had anxiety reflux kick back so hard that it cause two days of back to back panic attacks. My anxiety was so bad that I couldn’t eat anything but rice and chicken, no meds, and being around doctors frighten me. I couldn’t manage to get myself out of that anxiety loop. 

Well I was finally about to get some hydroxyzine  for “as needed dosage” 3 weeks later. My anxiety was down back to a manageable level but my fears were still there. I took one 25 mg pill in the evening. I got an euphoria feeling and drowsiness the whole next day along with diarrhea. Then all my anxiety was gone. I can eat food again without fear. I’m not scared to take meds again. 

This is the weirdest Anxiety is the moment I have ever dealt with. However, I’m now pondering if with my anxiety reflux being kicked up it had my stomach and brain a relay lap so when I took the hydroxyzine it suppressed that nerve in my stomach and it help my stomach feel better and then which stop the relay cycle. I guess that is something I will have to remember to ask my doctor.",Anxiety

I was also hyper aware of my face and trying to either keep a straight face or ""look impressed""/ ""don't give away that I'm not feeling it.""

Then, my friend insisted on buying that same lady for the lap dance. I was trying to politely say ""no"" but he didn't understand. Also, he bought two or three... Anyway, she kept grinding up on me. Now, another poster here told me that nobody would be paying attention to whether or not you become... ""aroused."" But trust me, she noticed. And she seemed kind of mad about it. And I ended up being depressed because I couldn't help but feel like something was wrong with me. I mean, not even a twitch.

I live a life of prescriptions and pain. I am tired, and drained both Physically and mentally/emotionally. I am in constant pain with anxiety, anger from pain, worthlessness, etc. I do not speak to my family anymore and have only one friend, whom of which I was in the Marines with. We both suffer from medical issues but not the same on mental health. I am not the type, typically, to open up to anyone or do things like posting this here. Realistically a stranger does not know you so opening up to one does not mean anything. Venting does not change facts or pain. I just want it to stop. I ride my zx10 150-180 pretty much everywhere in hopes that I hit some gravel, have a car pull out, or do not negotiate a turn at high speeds. I drive my little wrx way to reckless in hopes of the same. My buddy is scared to get in a car with me, or do activities, since I have no sense of self preservation. All my activities have become meaningless and not even fun even more. I used to go wheeling in my taco every Friday and loved it. Id enjoy fly fishing trips, sitting on a porch for 6 hours just staring at north Idaho beauty. And now None of it brings me joy.

49578,"Something I wrote before I knew I was bipolar. I used to think it was a personality disorder, instead of a mood disorder.   

Dear Journal…well I really don’t know that much about you being dear… that’s clearly a lie as it is the first time I write in this type of journal -though I had been writing quite often on “my phone journal”-. Either way, dear beloved, and most precious electronic journal, I will bless thee with the presence of worded words that word the words I word. Today’s riveting topic…. My day! As I don’t think I have the mental capacity to write about anything else of meaning… or do I? The purpose of this journal thing is to make me a better writer in both English and Spanish, yet if all I put into the white walls is rubbish and nonsense, how am I to become better at throwing electronic ink at immaterial wood-stuff? Perhaps I should find something… as simple as it may be…something I can turn into cohesion. I guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings… my feelings, nonetheless.

How does anxiety feel? I know we’ve all been there. Any E-scripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much, but, baring mental health professionals, I don’t think that those of us that enunciate the word “anxiety” with statistical-outlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean. What I mean by that, of course, is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way. I guess that’s why we get diagnosed… catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society. We’re a messy bunch. It reflects in all facets of my life.

I have messy hair, messy eyes, my room is messy my thoughts are scattered (and messy!), I can’t make a decision for the love of myself; the short version: I don’t work. I mean that both literally and figuratively, whatever that means! (think about it! What does the verb “to work” mean in a literal way? Is it having a job? But that’s having a job, we call it work because you do motions in a job, but we call the motions “work”, because “work” is the act of physical exertion right? I don’t know, this is literal garbage that I’m talking right now (talking/writing “garbage” can’t literally be literal (I think I just transferred a calque from Spanish, too long to get into this tangent))). I can’t hold a normal job; I can’t hold my emotions most of the times. Today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee, and I felt like as if I’ve murdered someone. I mean, I’ve never killed anyone -and I hope I never do such a heinous thing-, but you know that feeling you get in your chin, your chest and neck that pushes you down? The one you get when something bad, really bad is about to happen? I was feeling that over a coffee man. I stared the guy directly in the eye, not with the best of intentions. I was literally offended, but I don’t feel that it was in a normal way. How do I know that? Cause I didn’t use to be like that. Emotions, to me, seem to work now like to a BPD patient (perhaps I have BPD traits?). How do emotions work for BPD patients? Simple! Take an emotion X and then square it. A more detailed example: anger(in BPD afflicted individual) = anger\^2. Or perhaps it’s even a cubical function: i.e., anger\^3 (I don’t even remember if cube is exponential 3). Anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read.

Anxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason. Anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest you’ve been in ages. Anxiety is snapping at those who love you, because you can’t love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit. Anxiety is wanting to die, looking at places where you could hang yourself, feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing, imagining a knife to the throat, thinking about swerving into traffic, travelling, and not feeling anything, kissing someone you’re deeply into and not feeling anything, doubting everything you do, every single cell in your body being inadequate. Anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong, but still suffering through it. Anxiety is abusing drugs, anxiety is depression, anxiety is the antithesis of life, of enjoyment, of love and all that’s good. This is “anxiety”, as this is obviously a corrupted, poisonous version of a feeling that’s supposed to help us survive: i.e., anxiety. “Anxiety” turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive.

51460,"Hello, new here Hello everyone, lurker for a small while now. I'm 24M.

I'm in the process of getting diagnosed, cause my life is shit and I continually fail at anything and have no friends and never had a romantic relationship. Everything points to AvPD according to the psychiatric place I'm being diagnosed in, so I figured I'd check out the sub some time ago. I resonate with a lot of people in here, so I felt like I'd chip in a bit.

I've essentially lived in complete isolation for 3-4 months now except to buy groceries (on sick leave from my vocational school), only very rarely seeing family in that time. All social interaction is through online games (not that this has ever really been much different), which I do think help ground me a bit more in reality. I know that some of you guys have gone years without even that, and I'm sorry to hear it. I want to get better, finish my education, have one or two friends, a Roma tic relationship and a job. But life is fucking hard and most of the time it feels like a fact that none of it will ever happen, seriously fuck living like this.

I'm getting a little hope from knowing more about AvPD and that I most likely am about to be diagnosed, so I can get help, but even still I've had times today where I just feel like human waste that shouldn't be allowed to exist. I'm scared of getting hurt so I've never attempted suicide, even though I've fantasized about it a lot. I also couldn't bring myself to do anything like it because of my family, sometimes they're all that holds me from crossing my fear.

Anyways onto more non-death related shit, earlier I ordered food and have put a note to the delivery driver to just ring the doorbell and place it on the mat. I really hope they got the note, cause I look fucking terrible and struggle with taking regular baths. Besides my apartment looks so bad I'd rather not have anyone look inside, so yeah kinda just hope to be able to pick up my food in peace.

I was taking medication since mamy years ago. Got discharged at the begging of the year before starting college, had to get back at it again after starting the course. I took the same meds as before which I used for years, but my body didn't understand that I have already took then before and had some side effects that scared me and I stopped taking one of the meds. Then after the end of my 1st semester I was looking worse with my depression, so my psychiatrist decided to give me adult depression meds... safe to say it backfire extraordinarily, I just turned 18, barely a month ago. 

Went to other doctors and and the 1st side effect went away, but the adult medication gave me more and worse side effects, so again me psychiatrist suggested changing meds. My mom already had some bad impressions on the doctor so after they tried to change again with no wait to see if I'd get better, she told me to stop taking any meds altogether.

For a few weeks at a time maybe I will be not so suicidal but ultimately it is something i always end up coming back to.

Insomnia and Excessive Sleepiness haunt my life..At work, it is not any better...I do a Laborious Job and constantly feeling drained of energy while on the job makes me feel like I am not enough despite there being older people than me there who do not really feel tired...I have a constant feeling of disassociation, feeling like I do not belong in my own body...like my mind has been only added to it...I constantly see shadows or things that are not there and it is driving me insane sometimes..I constantly forget things when it is just been told to me and I hate it! I feel so..stupid for not remembering anything...I try so hard to remember what I just forgot, but it never comes back...I cannot even remember special things unless it is in writing...I feel like I am combatting myself.. Like I have two different personalities mixed into one. My personality before depression when I was a Teenager as a Freshman in High School and after depression hit... there is the Empathetic, Helpful, Patient side and then there is the Depressive Side where I am prone to being numb, very irritated, easy to anger, and just plain not caring about myself. it is...making me feel so...disconnected.I feel so bad when I get very irritated and mad at my Mom for not understanding my depression and just needing help on the same things I tell her about...she is forgetful sometimes and she needs time to understand...it is not her fault...I feel like a bad son sometimes...Then there is the heavy guilt and anxiety...I feel like I cannot control it even with the Medication I am taking...I feel like such a mess that nobody should be bothering with..All of this just makes me feel so disconnected from people...I want to be alone...but I do not at the same time... it is like my mind does not know what it wants anymore...I cannot even play MMORPGs and other genres of games I enjoy without feeling like I want to drop them as fast I got into them. it is so stressful and annoying...Even though I have a Job, a Loving Relationship of 5 Years, Family Members that I guess still care about me..I do not even care about myself. I still do not know what it means be truly happy...it never lasts..I always have to put up a Facade to avoid having to explain myself or worry people..I only recently found out what this is.. ""Smiling Depression"" I always one day hope I will not have to act like I am completely fine and stable, but everyday that hope dwindles till only nothing is left.. I feel like I should not exist. Sorry for ranting and getting how I feel off my chest...I should not be bothering anyone with this and should just suffer with it on my own...

I recently had a very bad depression episode few days ago, and even though I am done with the episode and my emotions are more stable right now, my brain doesn’t seem to be functioning in any way. 

I thinking of everything but nothing at the same time. Like I really can’t catch my thoughts or even think anything logically or sensibly. And I feel like a zombie, just do everything based on experience and instinct.

And the worst part is, people don’t understand that because you look completely normal and functional. They think you’re fine now because you stop crying or being depressed. You can finish normal tasks or conversation because you are in autopilot mode, but when it comes to something that requires more brainpower, you are broken.

Still am but as an adult I feel that control to get myself out of a situation when I feel sick) to now as a 45 year old person worrying about more serious things. A few years ago I was convinced I was having a heart attack. You know the drill, typical symptoms but all the while I kinda knew I wasn’t. But something was wrong. Turns out I have Graves’ disease/hyperthyroid. It’s auto immune so now the statistic that one autoimmune usually means multiple has freaked me out. I have symptoms but they are not typical hyperthyroid sometimes and now I have this history of that one time it actually WAS something. Graves’ disease isn’t that serious considering the big picture, though. And I did something incredibly stupid. I did a 23 and me health analysis thing. Major dumb. I don’t even have the results yet but here I go. I guarantee I will suddenly have 100 more diseases by the end of next month. And I know that one time, I was right. Something was wrong.

No doctors have suggested it and I’ve read through the detailed description and nothing matches.  The one thing that is similar is I’ve had mood swings that may last the span of a few days (elevated or mixed for a day/half a day and then sometimes depressed the three to four days following).  This happens maybe 5-10 times a year for me.

Most of my high and low episodes will last one to three months, but I do have these so called mild “blips”.  Most are relatively mild and controllable, but some are worse than others.

I write this because something trivial happened the other day and then I started to feel the hypomania coursing through my veins.  Racing thoughts, impatience, the need to get rid of the intense energy.

23345,"Delusional neighborsHi everyone, I live in LA and my neighbors like to talk outside in the hall of the apartment complex. Btw I live in the projects (talking to them nicely is not going to be a solution.)Do not know much about them since they live across the hall. All I know is that there are adults (let us call them the red neighbors) in their thirties or older, do not work and I think they live off food stamps like a lot of people in the projects. There are a total of 5 women possibly not sure. Most of their time they spend talking outside their apartment door, hallway, or staircase. My apartment is less than 20 feet from the staircase so I guess they can hear when I am doing my chores. Lately, I noticed that they have been giving me stares when I see them outside. They used to talk to me before when I moved in years ago ""hi neighbor, how are you?"" when they would see me but shortly after that we stopped. No reason at all and well I do not mind because I have social anxiety so it is hard for me to speak to strangers even if they are my neighbors. So I might come off as shady to people but I am a no-one so why should someone care right? Anyways I also noticed that they have been talking ""quiter"" when I start cooking, or doing laundry, or washing my dishes but I feel like my neighbors think I am nosy and eavesdropping. They have not said anything to me directly but I have heard them say ""stop pretending your cooking"" or sometimes mentioning my apartment number. I am not sure if they were saying this subtle comment directly to me or whatnot but I am always listening to music with my earbuds on so maybe it is in my head.update: I wrote the top part a couple of days ago and left it as a draft bc I did not know what else to write but here is an update on this situation. they asked me when they found me in the lobby. ""I know you are listening to our conversations. do not act stupid. you pretend to cook so you can listen to what we are saying. "" me: ""I have never listened to any of your conversations nor does it interest me. I am often hearing music on my earbuds when I do my chorers. but if you do not like people listening in to your daily convos then I suggest talking outside of the building or in your own apartment"" neighbors: ""I know you are fucking lying. if you continue to do this ill fuck you up!"" I was taken aback by this ""confrontation"" bc I am allowed to do my chores at any time of day. just bc they are out there talking does not mean I should stop and not do it at all until they leave. So I am a bit shaken up since I have anxiety I am getting very nervous. I do know that they were not bluffing when it came down to fighting me. like I mentioned I live in the projects and it is not the nicest place to live nor are people nice here. I can not move out since I have not finished school nor do I have a full-time job. Can anyone help me with how I should go about it??? I am freaking out. i live with other family members and I am scared they might harm them too. we are on the skinny and petite side while they are tall and big so we are at a disadvantage here. I just cannot wrap my head around the reason why they are mad at me. do they feel entitled and why? are they on drugs that it has damaged how they think? Or are other neighbors on my floor talking shit about me to them? I once heard another neighbor (orange neighbor) who I have never talked to but I know his voice since he likes to join them in the hallway. Well, he referred to me as the Spanish female and he kept on repeating my apartment number. To this day I have no idea why. I know this because he was yelling at this point. that another neighbor (pink neighbor) had to come out and calm him down (btw pink, orange, and red neighbors know each other. I think they grew up in the same building since they were children. Also, all the neighbors are thirty or beyond since they have kids) Another instance was that the red neighbors were fighting outside in the hall that pink neighbors stepped in and said to lower the volume bc ""Spanish girl"" is listening. Tf why would I be listening plus I am not the only person living on the floor there are other families and they are being loud enough for everyone to hear. Mind you I was nowhere doing chores but in my bedroom and they were loud enough for me to hear. I just do not get why they are picking on me and I am the Spanish girl since I am the only Spanish on my floor. Why would Pink neighbors say that? Could it be bc they hold a grudge against me? Before COVID pink neighbor's kids used to play in the hall and their kids intentionally would hit my door with a basketball and kick it while laughing. I confronted them and never apologized instead they acted as If I was the villain. Btw all of these neighbors also do not work is that why they are so interested in me since they have nothing else to do??? I start working soon in person again so hopefully, I do not run on them but that is probably a lie since they stay at home all the time. I just do not understand what is it about me that they feel like they could bully me. I have been bullied before so this brings back memories and makes me feel like shit. If anyone could suggest something I would appreciate it. Delusional neighbors",Suicidal

46088,"I'm depressed Friend of mine, who I valued a lot, just cut all ties with me. Told me that I’m too needy and emotional. They’re not wrong. I’m bipolar and I had a really fucked up childhood which caused a lot of abandonment issues, something I’m in therapy for now. It does make me very emotional at times, and I do tend to be super clingy during depressive episodes. Lately I’ve been rapid cycling, which causes me to have more of them. They knew all this, and I was hoping they would understand. But, they told me that they don’t want anything to do with me, and never want to see me or talk to me again. Feels weird. Just this Monday, my therapist told me that my fear of abandonment is just that, a fear, and I need to overcome it. Told me that I need to open new pathways in my brain and know that people won’t leave me. This doesn’t help with that at all.


I started a new job this week, and it’s mind numbingly boring and insanely hard. I’m only on week one and I already hate it. I’m dreading going to work today. But I need this job. It pays well, and I have a decent amount of debt that I need to pay back.


Because of my childhood, I don’t feel like I can ever trust my parents. I’m not close to any of my family. After having so many friends walk out on me over the years, I feel like I can’t trust the friends who did stick with me. I feel like things just need to get a bit harder and they’ll leave too.


I have/had dreams about doing something in the entertainment field. But lately I don’t feel any drive or motivation to chase after that. I don’t see the point in it. I wanted fame and money because I thought I could give the people I love awesome things with it. But I don’t really love anyone anymore. I’m always paranoid and worried that everyone will leave me.


I just feel so alone all the time. I feel like no one really understands me. I feel like I can’t connect. Even with my therapist, I can’t really tell her how I feel. Because sometimes my thoughts are really fucked up and when I tell people, they freak out on me. Medication doesn’t help. I just hate waking up in the morning now. The only times I ever feel ok is when I drink or take something. I just really hate life right now. I wish there was a permanent way to just numb everything.",Bipolar

Not sure if he actually needed it, I suppose when it is not raining frogs are not gona be quite so wet. Anyways, I spent a few minutes going back and forth between holding him and trying to comfort him before letting him go and catching him when he hopped away. I imagine it is hard to be calm in the palm of a giant. Those few moments just felt so much more fulfilling than any time with most people. it is such a simple bond and it is not even reciprocated. But it does not need to be. The frog was probably terrified, how could anything not be in the play of a giant? But all I wanted was to calm it, help get it a little water. I felt bad putting it back outside, knowing the world is even more terrifying for it than it is for me, with predators and dangers. So easily this worry and true care for this frog came, where it comes so much more difficult with people. And it makes me think of the world.

48340,"Is the stress of my international sales job worth the benefits? Looking for guidance….. Hi,

I’m a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country. After relocating my family and settling into our new home, I found the job to be manageable, albeit stressful, for the first 8-9 months.

However, after a year, I've realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine, and it's starting to change my personality. I'm experiencing burnout, feeling completely drained, unmotivated, and even depressed at times. I report to upper management located overseas who may not fully understand the realities of building a new operation in a foreign country. Despite being expected to do more with less, the results are still expected.

I'm struggling to decide if I should push through this or throw in the towel. On one hand, the benefits of international experience, such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives, are invaluable. On the other hand, the stress is taking its toll, and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I would appreciate any advice from those who have been in similar situations or know someone who has. It can be quite isolating, and I lack a trusted network of experienced expats to turn to for guidance. Thank you in advance for your help.",Stress

I am thankful that this platform exists, I am not sure if anyone will even read this, but I have reached my capacity and I need help. To the average person you could think my life is pretty normal. I have a home, I have a car, I have a family who cares for me. But I am completely lost in life. I am 23, and when I graduated high school in 2016, I had no idea what to do with my life. My dad, who was my best friend and greatest ally, died unexpectedly of a heart attack in October of 2016. I was not only lost, I was devastated. Still am. My family still is. Anyways, I never thought I had the determination or courage to go to college, so I stayed at my restaurant job I had. I had been there for 6 years, then in May this year, I quit. No two weeks or anything. I was so tired of the same routine that happened there and the toxicity of the place, so I left. I have never thought of myself with any high regard. I do not think I am pretty, or smart, or fun. I have always seen myself as a burden on anyone who comes near me. This has proven to be true time and time again. I had a 3 year relationship with a man I love deeply, but he left me for someone else in November of 2020. He always told me I was crazy, needed help he could not provide, and so on. When that happened, I was fully convinced that I ws better off dead. i knew i did not want to be alone with my intrusive thoughts. but i kept on. kept working. kept trying. i met a few other men after that, all who further proved the fact that i am not worthy of love. All left me. I am now unemployed with rent due at the end of the month. i have a roommate who is counting on me. i tried to make it work at another job, but it became clear after my first week that i was not in a healthy enough mental space to work there. all the friends i have are too busy with their significant others to lend me some help.i feel no hope for myself. this feels like the universe telling me that i am not needed here. i want to live. i want to feel the happiness that i know might be possible for me. but i have no clue how to get there. it feels like i have no guidance. my motivation is constantly outweighed by my doubts and anxiety. i just want to have a place in the world. any thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated, and it just might save my life. I have no money, no guidance, and no idea. If you read this, I love you and thank you. Please reach out. Julia Every day feels hopeless",Suicidal

Ok i've made posts about things I've felt before but somehow everything I had 2 weeks ago is now gone and has been replaced by new fears.

I'll get straight to it, here are symptoms with context:

- Odd feeling on left side of body, mainly legs, only when laying or sitting. Feels like weakness but I can still walk just fine and feel no difference in balance. Sort of like fatigue without any actual excercise to cause it, really odd and it scares me.

- Tinnitus, already diagnosed 2 years ago with bilateral tinnitus and it's got easier to deal with. But in times like these it makes me feel awful. I'm aware of the recent progresses in Tinnitus treatment so it doesn't worry me too much as it's benign and only sounds when i'm in silence.

- Constipation, probably caused by the stress or anxiety. Either way it might be causing me problems.

- Intermittent sharp stomach pains on the left side of my abdomen under ribs, I called the doctor about it and he said it was nothing lethal or worrying but to get it checked out anyway. That my current worst fear, that I had a digestive infection caused by the constipation. 

- A feeling that for some reason, I'm going to die tomorrow from some lethal random attack of sorts, like my intestines will rupture from a tiny stomach pain, or that I'll have a heart attack because I can sometimes hear pounding in my head. That's the worst of all of this, the never being able to relax, I feel on edge 24/7. Researching everything that I can in order to reassure myself, only to find an even worse disease that vaguely correlates to my symptoms.

I always feel the urge to check my speech to see if it's slurred, or check my heartrate to check for palpitations, or check my typing to check for stroke/ALS. I seriously can't keep living like this, why do I keep getting these physical symptoms?!

Many thanks, Max

33919,"I've been crying all day - sure my time is up About 3 years ago, a good friend of mine passed away from acute leukemia at the age of 19. I was devastated, and with a lifelong battle with health anxiety it always lingered in my mind anytime I would get ill. Would this be the time I faced the same fate?

Well now this time I'm more or less certain that the time has come. I came down with some infection from a coworker back on November 18th. At first is was merely a slight sore throat, some coughing, malaise. I began to feel better around the end of November. Then the first week of December the sore throat came back. And fever, severe congestion, cough, fatigue, achy muscles amongst other things. I began to feel better from that, but have not been the same since. As of right now, I have a terrible cough, irritated throat , congestion. I have been having night sweats where my neck and head get very damp, but I am not drenched and it only affects the head and neck. I am simply not myself. 

The positives that have kept me hopeful I do not have acute leukemia :
-I have been able to make it to the gym to lift about 3-4 times a week. I don't have much motivation to do so, but I make it and my strength is still there. 
-I have not lost any weight, gained a few pounds actually, currently at 6'0"" and 220 pounds
-when I do feel bad, I'm never running a fever, my temp is usually somewhere between 96.9 and 98.5
-I'm not bruising at all, even after bumping into things, and I don't have any petechia anywhere to suggest low platelets
- my infections haven't been severe, per se. I haven't had sore throats like that of strep and no mouth sores or bleeding gums , they've just been persistent 
- I've been going out on the weekends with friends for a few drinks, which ironically when I am not sober I do not experience night sweats at all
- the guy who originally got me sick is still sick himself, and my entire family is sick back and forth

But nonetheless, I can't help but think this is it for me. I just keep looking at pictures of my mom or baby sister or handmade birthday cards from my sister - just little sentimental things - and I start crying like a baby. I don't want to leave them, I don't want my family and friends to go through what my friend's loved ones went through three years ago when they lost her, I love life so much and I don't want it to end. It's all I can think about though.  I don't really know where to go from here. Nobody in my family thinks it's odd I've been sick for the better part of 6 weeks, and I put on a front to everyone that I'm fine to not alarm them, but on the inside I'm falling apart.",Anxiety

50857,"don't be like me (little rant) I was a college freshman at the beginning of covid. I was just your stereotypical introverted/ quiet guy who also struggled in social situations. Covid gave me THE perfect excuse to avoid anything stressful. Don't have to go to class, don't have to meet anybody, everyday I just drowned myself in entertainment. Eventually I dropped out of class and basically became a shut in.

Fast forward to a couple years later. I have no idea how time went by so fast. Everyone is all grown up and busy, people keep asking about how I'm doing at school, and everytime I lie to my parents that yeah I'm going to school, I did good on my exams, I'm about to graduate etc. It's so fucking unfair to my parents that I turned out to be such a piece of shit. 

I hate what I've become, just lies and avoidance. When I'm actually motivated to do something, I'm then immediately reminded by the reality that no matter what I do I still wasted all these years of my adulthood, that I'm still betraying my parents' expectations, that nothing I do is going to undo all the damage I did to myself. 

I'm a mess. I have no hobbies I can share with normal people, I have no humor because I don't have any experience in the real world, I can't make my family happy because I don't even like myself and it shows. 

Sorry for the rant, sometimes you take a step back and really look at the situation you put yourself in and it's unbearable. Why didn't I try harder at school? Why didn't I tell my parents the truth? Facing all these fears, I chose the easy way. And it is clearly the wrong choice, otherwise I wouldn't be suffering this much now. 

If you're reading this I hope you can learn not to be like me. Avoidance is hell.",Personality disorder

51110,"snippets about me that maybe y'all can relate to This is an incomplete list of course, but I've taken ages to build up the motivation to post SOMETHING here, this is what I got for now. I'm hoping anyone reading this would please add to the conversation their own similar experiences or attributes, or would please ask me to expand on any point I have listed.
--------------------

	1. I need to consume multiple forms of media on multiple devices in order to be content. I divide my attention towards trivial topics.

	2. I have detailed dialogue in my head that I desperately wish I could record, but whenever I try it's not detailed, I get tired of it, and it ends up unfinished. I have countless unfinished drafts and scattered files that I take endless time to organize, only to still not post what I initially wanted to.

	3. I take hours to get myself ready to go out (typically to my local dive bar). I know I'll enjoy myself when I get there and I know a lot of familiar friends and faces there. But once it's time to leave I psych myself out over going; my primary concern is that I don't look as nice as I usually do, or I'll get a detached, disassociated feeling once I get there. Many nights I end up going to bed with my outfit and makeup freshly done and still on, never have left my place.

	4. The red notification circle showing me the amount of unread text and unanswered calls I have is so large that it breaks me out to open the damn thing at all. I end up ghosting relationships that I didn't want to abandon. The guilt of how long it's been when they last sent a message to present day keeps me from responding. If I have to make plans with someone, I have to actively not look at the other unread messages below it or else I'll have an internal panic.

	5. I'm self-isolated and alone and lonely more than I ever have to be and I fucking know this. I highly value people and relationships, despite how my avoiding nature implies otherwise.

	6. My childhood consists of consistent moving for rarely to none disclosed reasons. My mom is an aggressive woman who's genuinely diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it's difficult to communicate with her. Growing up, I never lived in a location even close to 2 years. I think this has fucked me up in many ways.

	7. I am a very vivid and active dreamer. I speak frequently in my sleep- sometimes I wake myself up for my own talking. 4 years I had chronic nightmares and was a bedwetter; the nightmares and accidents were most frequent after every move. This subsided by age 24, when I was done with University and moving as frequently.

	8. I've used meth for nearly 8 years; via smoking and snorting, never injections. It's never made me feel horny like it does most people. I compare the sensation to taking 'dirty Adderall'; meaning I have a zombified, obsessive focus on whatever task. I'm either indulging in rabbit holes or addictively playing chess on my phone. More broad and accurate to say is that I productively procrastinate; my place will get so clean or I fulfill minuscule to-do task, but I continue to avoid my most pressing and urgent needs. 

	9. Actual Adderall feels like medicine to me. Like the focus increase isn't jarring, but natural. There's no crash and no tweaked out feeling. I feel like what I believe I'm supposed to feel like, as a content and motivated individual. ",Personality disorder

It started with bad heart palpitations and arm pain and I took multiple trips to the urgent care center and a few ekgs, and they all said I was fine. It takes me so long to fall asleep at night because of this, I get anxiety attacks often, and I've formed a habit where I need to knock on wood almost all the time to calm me down a bit (weird habit)  
  
I'm not overweight and I go for bike rides a lot but my dad is always telling me to workout because he loves working out. I tried it months ago but the fear I was going to have one multiplied and I couldn't stand feeling my heart beat. He's trying to have me do guided meditation but for some reason that makes me way more anxious than when I started. He hasn't wanted me to go to therapy because I haven't ""committed to his solutions yet"".   
I get and appreciate he's trying to help but I really wanted professional help.

34479,"Have I been having heart attacks?! As of late I’ve been experiencing pains on the inside of my left arm and frequent sharp pain in my chest to the left of my breast plate. Sometimes the pain radiates across my chest and shoulder and other times it can be one or the other. I’ve also been experiencing rapid heart rates from little physical activity and high blood pressure. I do have pretty severe health anxiety and also suffer from digestive problems as well so I can be sure if it is just my anxiety manifesting physical symptoms. I went to the ER last week and they said the blood tests showed no signs of it being heart related but my PCP decided to have me wear a heart monitor patch for a week and that made me more conscious of my palpitations and pains. Today is first day since I’ve taken it off and sent it in. While I was eating lunch (normal meal that shouldn’t have triggered anything) I experienced hot flashes across my body and then the pains started again. Has anyone experienced similar symptoms?

14666,"Life is not as bad as it could be. But here I am, drinking myself to drunkenness after being sober for over a month. Every day I think about the tasks I want to achieve, and slowly - painfully slowly - watch as the time moves forward with nothing done. Minutes to hours, hours to days, and I get not even a fraction done of what I wanted. Every night is a rebirth as I think of all the wonderful things I will do in the morning, every second into consciousness the next day a slow death as I fail. Fail to act. Fail to bother failing. I watch as years go by and the dreams I had when I was fresh out of college seem further and further away. they are always in the background, on the shelf. Waiting for me as the sense of urgency to make something of myself vanishes.I had a therapist. I could go back to her. She was nice. Kind. She cried once, as I was telling a story of my life - and that split second of humanity meant the world to me. My pain was validated - if I could bring her to tears, maybe the trauma I had gone through was actually fucked up? Maybe I could not feel quite as guilty for pushing so many people away, for crippling my own success, for never giving myself a break? For being so miserable? For being weak?But just like the rest of my life, that moment has long since died. I have no excuses anymore. I will die a failure. Forgotten. Because I have two jobs and no time for therapy....... but really, I just do not want to acknowledge these faults. I thought I was done with this illness.The alcohol is hitting harder since it is been so long. it is been so long since I have been able to acknowledge this despair...And I am sabotaging myself again.

34954,"Healthy anxiety is literally going to kill me (Sorry for the essay) Okay so you're all going to probably think I'm a nut job and you're probably right.. I've been a bit of a hypochondriac since a child but it's gotten way worse in recent years (I'm now 27). I actually don't even know what to do anymore? I went to counselling about this last year and it did zilch! The past year has been my absolute worst!!!

I'm a Googler and it's really starting to piss me off! Every single pain I get I end up googling it and lose my shit thinking it's cancer or something deadly. Heck, sometimes I don't even Google it and I just assume it's something bad! The anxiety got that bad in the summer time that I was crying every night and having no sleep thinking I was going to die and couldn't get out of bed for work. I'd literally made my self depressed. I then did actually get really ill from all the worry and stress. I just don't want to have death thoughts everytime I feel a pain or a niggle! I'm even getting scared of feeling my own breasts incase I feel a lump!!! I also hate it when I see articles on Facebook telling you the symptoms to look out for for certain cancers and then those symptoms are stuck in my brain for life and I end up tying those symptoms to my pains and thus the anxiety begins! I'm literally stressed and on edge every single day now, it's exhausting!

So my question is, is there anybody else out there suffering with this too? And how are you coping with it? I literally can't go on like this, feeling like i'm going to die all the time. It's an absolute waste of life.

To begin ive been dealing with health issues since early September (about 4 months now). Could possibly be lyme or something else but the results were not very cut and dry. Ever since these health issss started ive been weighed down by “brain fog” or at least thats how I describe it to doctors. Ive read a bit about brain fog on here but my symptoms seem a bit different, could this still be alk anxiety (most of my doctors have labled this as my issue)

My symptoms of what i call “brain fog” is mainly visual, things look and seem a bit “off/weird” not exactly blurry but just off. This feeling has been with me before (when i had mono 2 years ago) but it only lasted about 3 weeks, this time has been about 3 months constantly. My other symptoms are daily headaches, dizzy/unstable feeling, a feeling or fuzzy/congestion in my head (not really in sinuses but in head) and just feeling out of it.

I read a lot on this reddit about not being able to remember things or think clearly/concentrate. I dont have these issues, mine seem to be mainly visual paired with headaches. Is this being caused by my health anxiety? If not do you have any ideas?

Ive had an MRI, two CT scans and tons of bloodwork done in the last three months. All normal except my lyme came back positive. However after antibiotic treatment and still seeing strange results from bloodwork we are thinking it could be a false positive.  I definitely have anxiety about my health (been a rough few months) but I feel like of it was anxiety it wouldn’t be causing these constant all day symptoms!  Any help is greatly appreciated.

18095,"I grew up in a town that was huge on high school athletics. Pretty much every boy was expected to play something or else they were treated as different. I am on the spectrum myself and sports were the thing I turned to when I wanted to escape the reality of my situation. Ill be the first to admit I was a bit of a jock and because of that status, people barely recognized my condition or at the very least, gave me a pass for it. I played 3 sports, which I dominated in and was a ladies man throughout my teen years. I was truly on top of the world. Each year, my school would hold a massive pep rally a month into the school year. The pep rallys were an all day thing that would feature multiple events. The biggest event of them all was the athletic competition. Hundreds of students, boys and girls, would compete in multiple activities and would be eliminated one by one until a winner was crowned. I had won the competition during my freshman, sophomore, and junior year. In the 50+ year history of the event, I was the only student who had ever won three straight competitions. I was fully prepared to win a fourth straight and complete the dynasty. The athletic director had told me the school would gift me a scholarship fund if I was able to win it all one more time. As usual, I breezed through the competition early and comfortably secured my spot in the final round yet again. No surprises there. This time my finals opponent would, for the first time, be a girl who just happened to be a freshman. She was tall and lanky and posed no real threat to me off the naked eye. The final round would consist of a basketball shootout, first to 10 wins. Basketball is my best sport and I felt as if they were almost gifting the championship to me. I took an early 5-0 lead but she ended up getting into a lucky hot streak and won 10-7. She defeated me and became the champion. I was humiliated and went into a massive depression. I know that I deserved to be the one holding that trophy and seeing her hoist it up killed me. The rest of my senior year remains a blur to me. To put even more salt in the wound, the same girl that defeated me would go on to win the competition in her 10th/11th/12th grade years. She got the dynasty that she denied me of. The pain comes and goes but has been really strong recently. I was humiliated and will never be able to live it down. I know its silly because I am 28 and she is 24 now but I just cannot seem to let go of the past. I know its unhealthy to be this upset all these years later, but I cannot help but think about it each night. I toss and turn thinking about how all of this it could have been prevented had I just won. I could have been the one who completed the dynasty, not that lucky little bitch who has ruined my life.

I never told my mother, I felt like nobody could not accept me and it affected my performance in school and my relationship with other people.Fast forward, at the beginning of my time as in 11th grade, I was diagnosed with depression and I even had to lie to some of the doctor's questions so that the results will not be worse.

I know I hurt her a lot today by being honest.. but in a way I also feel better cuz I was holding this in for over a decade and a half. My dad is her enabler. And I have no one. I do not know what to do. The anxiety of them calling me again or me talking to them next time is freaking me out.How do I deal with this? She says she has a lifetime of trauma which is worse than mine and she got over it so I should too. I do not know how to respond to that when she is the source of my trauma. She refused to accept professional help when I was a kid and if she did I might not have gone through what I did. Is it fair for her to say that to me??

Would I drown? If I did perhaps that would be good and then if I failed what would happen then? Would I be fished out by someone or would I just gradually make my way to the shore? What then?

And now its kind of hard for me to apply for admission to universities and colleges because my grades are down compared to the average. However I am sure Ill be accepted in one at least, that is not the problem.The problem is my family, they are so disappointed in me to the point its suffocating. My mother always keeps nagging me about how no universities will accept me. She keeps reminding me how I neglected my studies and that none of my siblings have ever been through what I am in right now. She just makes me stressed and makes me feel like I should just disappear. I know she has been taking care of me but she is unbelievably negative. She just keeps bringing this topic day and night to the point I wonder how come she does not ever get tired. You see, I used to get good grades until this year, actually almost perfect grades like its normal and I never really tried so hard to do that. that is because I was paying attention to the classes, that is why I did not need to study that much really. But this year since it was distance education I could neglect my classes and I have done so. that is why I am full aware its my fault that my grades have fallen and my mom is not really wrong. But I feel like there is no way out. I cannot go back in time to correct my mistakes. I need to move on. But I cannot. My mom already decided its done for me. Why? I just want to get rest. I am worn out. Why should she make me want to end my life. You see its not only this, I also have other problems besides education but it will never end if I keep on. I just want to know, do I not deserve rest? Do I have to just kill myself because of my past mistakes? Does my mother have the right to do this to me? Should I just let it go because she cannot control her resentment of me?Its not just her, they all keep bringing this topic even if they are not overreacting like my mother. Honestly, I have already lost motivation to do anything at all by now. I do not even feel like resuming my education even if I got accepted.

Yes, people on here claimed that that was my problem without knowing me and without me saying anything of the like.**''it is your mindset, that is what keeps people from befriending / falling in love with you''*Yeah, right. that is why abusive men who just know how to act normal in front of others get to have beautiful, normal, lovely women by their side who are unable to break up because the guy made her seriously love him. These kinds of people have the most fucking insecure mindset you could imagine but because they are just so good at dealing with people by nature without having to practice the tiniest fucking bit everyone wants to suck their cocks.**''You just have not found the right people yet''**I am fucking 24. TWENTY-FOUR. THE OLDER YOU GET THE HARDER IT GETS. STOP DISMISSING EVERYTHING FOR FUCKS SAKE!!!! HOW MUCH LONGER UNTIL I FIND ''THE RIGHT PEOPLE''?IF YOU ASSUME THAT EVERYONE / MOST PEOPLE ARE SHIT, YOU ARE TOLD IT IS YOUR FAULT FOR BEING ALONE BECAUSE YOU THINK OF OTHERS THAT WAY, IF YOU do not, PEOPLE TELL YOU ALL THE PEOPLE you have MET WERE JUST SHIT. WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  FUCK WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHITAnd EVERY FUCKING TIME I tell THIS to people (both of the above) they shut the fuck up because they realise that I am right, but at the same time they will not admit it because they subconsciously seem to believe that admitting these things makes their lives pointless and they want to kill themselves. Worst case, because they are out of arguments, they just say ''you are wrong. you are just depressed. it is your depression talking.'' or they even get angry XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD**''You are your own best friend''**Have fun getting a good job from yourself. Have fun having sex with yourself. Have fun talking to yourself. Have fun living 90 years of your stupid live and dying all alone by yourself.**''You are not being kind to yourself. Just because someone rejected your friendship does not mean that there is anything wrong with you.''**Yeah, be kind to yourself for being absolute dog shit at everything you do, even when you do it for 8 hours a day for 12 years of your life. Be kind to yourself for breaking your wardrobe out of anger. A couple of doors. A window. Be kind to yourself for being snappy with the few friends you had and treating them badly (NO I do not DO IT ANYMORE, PEOPLE STILL FUCKING HATE ME, YES THAT MEANS I HAVE IMPROVED BUT IT does not MEAN ANYTHING TO OTHER PEOPLE APPARENTLY, and let us NOT act like it is a giant achievement anyway). Be kind to yourself for being so incredibly socially awkward with people that they automatically assume you are a rapist serial killer werewolf. Be kind to yourself and every one of your problems will magically go away. it is just like just believing in yourself that you are going to pass the exam tomorrow without having studied for it at all, or having studied for 5 days straight without understanding a single thing because you are too stupid.it is all bullshit. What these people do not understand is that having a ''positive mindset'' ONLY WORKS IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR. I CANNOT BE HAPPY BY BEING IGNORANT OF WHAT I AM.**''I am just trying to help''**How incredibly self-less of you. Are you? Or are you just telling yourself that so you can think that you are much greater than you already think you are? This is a classic defensive reaction when people realise that what they just said is incredibly dismissive and mean.Some of these people even claim they have depression and at the same time call suicidal people selfish (or ''more selfish'', my enw favourite).People are SO unable to see life through someone else's lens it is fucking disgusting. You talk and talk. You seriously believe just because your life is perfect and you get EVERYTHING you want means that everyone can do it and they are just NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH. FUCK YOU! Just because YOU are happy being alone does not mean that everyone can be. Just because you are happy with never being loved does not mean that everyone can feel the same. Just because you do not care that you are horrendously shit at conversation does not mean that everyone can accept it. Just because you are fine with being unfuckable does not mean everyone likes being it. Stop being so fucking arrogant and ignorant. Admitting these things does not mean that you are shit and that you should kill yourself. If you can deal with it, GOOD FUCKING JOB! No, seriously, I am glad that you are fine with yourself. But also seriously, GET OVER YOURSELF and stop FUCKING DISMISSING PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS AND SUFFERING. it is SO INFURIATING.Yeah I would kill myself if I could, BUT I cannot. I literally cannot get ANYTHING right in my life. I am too afraid to die. I just want to stop suffering. I am so sick and tired of not belonging anywhere. I am so sick and tired of being the universe's laughing stock. I am so sick and tired of being my parent's toy. I am so sick and tired of being shit at EVERYTHING I do no matter how hard I study or practice. it is completely fucking hopeless.I JUST do not IMPROVE.I talked to so many people I did not know at all and my ''SOCILAOIAILL SK)ILLZZZ''JUST NEVER GET FUCKING BETTER. I CANNOT IMPROVE. I CANNOT DO ANYTHING BY MYSELF. it is POINTLESS.I will just get drunk again. I finally know why my mother keeps doing it.

2. It’s only one on the left side of my groin. I had a spider bite (I’m assuming, could have been some other kind of bug. Was definitely a bite) on my business. That healed up a few days ago, the node hasn’t even slightly changed.

35273,"Shin splints persisting for more than a month, dont know if i should wait...  

Hey people.

Back in december 8th, i had some ankle pain which came after sitting or sleeping, and went away after walking for a bit. This continued until around new years eve and went away. During that, i have been trying to get a faster 5k time, running 2 times a week at a moderate pace. Keeping at it, at january 16th, i ran significantly faster because i increased my cadence from 165 to 180, so i took 4 minues off my 5k.

The day after, my shin started hurting, a dull ache on the upper 2/3 just outside my shinbone. The pain was very diffuse, and I still have trouble finding out if it is my bone or muscle hurting. However this pain came only when i stood for a long time, and at night. Running on it didnt really change the pain, however I was limping a little bit (a friend pointed it out, he didnt know about it).

I stopped running on the 22nd january, hoping it would get better, However, the pain persisted. At the 31st of january, I called my doctor and asked for an appointment, she game me one at february 26th, which i think is a long time to wait with this ache, however since it didnt really hurt THAT bad, so i guess i could wait (pain is 3-4 out of 10).

On february 2nd, i went skiing, and the pain subsided a littlebit, however it has been acompanied with a sharper, more localized pain an inch below my tibial tuberosity, and one to the left of it(PIC: [https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r](https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r)) . I dont know if this is because I have fallen a couple of times (I had many more bruises, but they disapeared 4-5 days after coming home). I came home on the 10th of february, and My pain still persists, i have tried the RICE method, and stretching, nothing works.

At the point im typing this, I havent run for a long time, and its been 10 days since ive been skiing. The pain has increased this week, and today it is on an all time high. I can still walk, and bike, but it is starting to intefere even more, and the ankle pain has come back too. I to have my legs up for as long time as possible, the last days i have rested 10 hours minimum in the daytime, practicing RICE.

Should I call my doc to get an earlier appointment? I called her today to ask for advice, based on this story, she assumed it was shin splints and told me to stretch.

What do you think it is?  
I may add that i am a hypochondriac, and somewhere inside me keeps telling me it could be bone cancer, and I really hate that, so I try to stay optimistic, and think about the rarity of it, albeit I am on strong Immunosuppressants. The thought of it being cancer and just assuming it is something else makes me extremely anxious.

TL;DR: Dull shin pain began after running pb (15th jan), stopped running about a week after, pain persisted, and after 8 days of skiing (1st feb-9th feb), has gotten accompanied by a sharp pain in the bone. (Pic of location: [https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r](https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r)) from friday it started getting worse. I have an appointment on the 26th feb, should i call for an earlier? I am afraid this is more serious than a shin splint, maybe a stress fracture, maybe bone cancer...

I've never been so fucking financially and emotionally stressed out in my fucking life

-Stuck on a night shift working 10 hours a day for pay way under what I deserve for my experience and schooling

-2k in credit card debt due to stupid fucking bullshit coming out of nowhere and having to shell out money for it

-used up most of my TFSA because of stupid fucking covid hitting literally the same month of buying my first ever home and losing my good paying job due to the company using covid as a scapegoat and ""selling the company"" when in reality, the assholes fired all but 8 people and kept operations open

-girlfriend (should be fiancé but can't even spare 500 bucks for a decent engagement ring right now) is stuck in workers comp hell because of a work injury. They didn't send her any fucking money for months then sent her a big lump sum of money, and now a month later claim they overpaid her a grand and she has to pay it back, leaving me to cover the house payments until she can afford to help again. Seriously, WCB is a fucking joke with a bunch of dumbass monkeys working for them.

- stuck with a shitty car that has way too many problems for being bought brand new in 2018 and the dealership is just as shitty as WCB and actively try to fuck me over (as all dealerships do)

My goddamn hair is turning white and I'm so full of just pure rage most of the time now that I get frequent migraines.

50903,"I confronted my kid's teacher today My kid has been having issues with this teacher all year. They really struggle with concentration and memory and the teacher has been terribly unsupportive. It's the only class my kid has been failing.

A few months ago my kid was diagnosed with cancer. We set up a 504 to reduce the amount of assignments and give them extended time.

They were then out of school for two weeks for surgery. All of their teachers except the problem teacher followed the 504 and greatly reduced the amount of their makeup assignments.

Regardless, my kid worked hard to turn in a large portion of the assignments. Yet, they're still failing that class.

I emailed the teacher today to make sure she graded all the assignments. She told me she did, but otherwise did not give me any helpful information in getting my child's grade up. I then asked if she has been following the 504 plan and I've not received a response.

I've already been second guessing whether I was too aggressive in my emails, but at the same time I feel like I'm going to have to escalate it with the school.

I'm stressed and I've been fucking sick to my stomach all day. I'm cycling between anger and embarrassment and I'm going nuts.

Just needed to vent 😞

Edited: Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I've been in continued correspondence with the teacher. She stated that she has already reduced the amount of work, but I still have issue with the amount and content.

I also elaborated on the fact that my child has been having issues all year only in this class. My child has told me they're afraid of this teacher and they struggle with her teaching methods. The teacher had no helpful comments, and has only repeated that ""the issue is missing assignments"" as if I don't have eyes. She also said she thinks they can turn this semester around if ""we"" can motivate them, and thinks they are not having academic difficulties. This rubs me the wrong way because motivation starts in the classroom and she's clearly been lacking.

Hello 20M and I quit vaping 3 months ago after vaping for 4 years and I have no plans on going back. Picked up this habit in high school (peer pressure) and it continued because I was in the same group of friends since then. Vaped here and there in high school and every damn day in college. Chain vaping 55 mg nic salt pretty much. Obviously this is my fault, but I can’t help but think my future is uncertain and I probably fucked up my health. My lung has been feeling weird for a few months now and it’s causing me anxiety. It’s getting to the point where I don’t even want to do anything in college that could help my career because I think I’m going to die in the near future. Like what’s the point. Im convinced I’m going to die from lung cancer sometime in the future or cardiac issues. I’ve been having chest pain and it’s scary. I take an snri rn and it’s helping but the thoughts won’t go away. It’s getting to the point where I’m reconsidering my whole life because I feel like I ruined it.

People used to love looking at my art and sometimes I would get ""friends out of it"" but they would all just ignore me anyways after a week or two. And when talking about my interests no one cares and just talks about what they do and never ask what other things I like doing or if there is other things I do other than what I post on the internet. People around me do not even acknowledge me that much I til I mention I am upset. If they cared then they would not have to come in repair mode every fucking goddamn time. Instead I am stuck besides myself and my hobbies and I do not even really like the things I like anymore that much, so my mind wanders off to suicidal thoughts and wondering how life would be better without me at all in the picture. not even my boyfriend seems to acknowledge the pain I feel half of the time, and he knows I would drop anything I am doing and do anything for him. Like whatever I guess, I cannot talk about my pain without them adding it on with their own damn pain in the mix. Overall most of the time now I am a very nasty and overall more easily irritable now.

48950,"I had a mental breakdown at work and nearly lost my job This happened last Friday. I have always had an anxiety disorder and it has been worse with all the stress I have been under lately both at work as well as at home. I work for GM which everyone who don't work there knows as a good job, but in reality it has gone to shit. I was hired 16 years ago and was in the last group to get traditional pay, benefits, and a retirement plan so I can't find anything else that pays the same. Anyone hired after me is really fucked and there is a reason gm can't keep any of the new employees. I work in material handling and the company is working up towards outsourcing and cutting those jobs so they are cutting out full teams and overloading everyone that's left then telling us ""everything's going to change soon, just make it work for the next year"" I have some serious stuff going on at home that I don't want to get into and it just makes the work stress that much worse. On Friday I messed up, I knew I messed up and wasn't mad about getting written up or anything but the thing is, I spend 90% of my waking life (and my first ever anxiety attack was while I was asleep, I woke up thinking I was having a heart attack so probably my sleeping life also) feeling like something terrible is going to happen due to my anxiety. When I get in trouble, it felt like the end of the world. I took my break and paced around outside debating if I should call in my FMLA and leave work but when I came back something very small and stupid happened that set me off. I blew up on my group leader screaming at her that I can't fucking do this! Even though I hate GM she is the nicest lady and easily the best boss I have ever had and I feel like a complete scumbag. She tried to fire me and the union got it down to a suspension but I honestly couldn't feel worse if I had been fired. I'm so ashamed of myself for how I acted and have been in a deep depression for the last few days and haven't done much more than lay in bed crying. The worst part is that she thinks I did it because I was mad about the write up and thought I could bully her because she is a woman and week, apparently she has faced discrimination in previous jobs. I hate myself, I'm ashamed of myself, and even though I didn't get fired I feel like nothing will ever be ok again.",Stress

I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives, overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.

The average person is socially active, whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans, messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new, even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch-22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.

I'm incapable of organising a fun life, things, like viewing someone in family gathering and getting along with large groups of people and creating a good impression, are intimidating,nearly impossible for me. I'm behind in career, life experiences, life skills, energy. It's just difficult to even get a footing, iv been cut away for so long and many types have closed the door on me",Personality disorder

Nonetheless, she said that my mind is simply trapped in this pesimistic way of thinking, and I have to believe it can and will get better using therapy and medication. 

But at this time, I do not want to. I've had a strong, suicidal episode recently. I'm waiting for it to come back and drive me to an attempt. Seriously, will these thoughts pass by or what? I have a strong sense meds won't help with that and I'm scared if they would actually work. I'll probably start taking them tomorrow.

34849,"I've never had an ulcer and can't remember the last time I had acid reflux. Upper stomach pain... brain says cancer, logic says acid reflux or ulcer. Help? Mostly asking what an ulcer really feels like.

 I've never had one before as far as I know (I'm 29) and have never been diagnosed with one. But then again, because of insurance issues, I've not really been able to see a doctor in like. Years. It's ridiculous. Long story. Anyway, I'm hoping to get insurance and be able to at least be seen within the next few months. Until then, though, reassurance is kind of all I can get.

I know what that sharp burning acid reflux feels like, I used to get it sometimes in high school, but generally, I don't ever experience that. I honestly can't remember the last time I got that sickly, burning acid reflux feeling. My diet's really bland out of preference (mostly vegetarian / some, but not a lot of meat) which I think contributes to a lot of my inexperience with acid reflux.

I have pain in my upper abdomen, right in the middle. I can't tell if I'm feeling it in my esophagus, liver or upper stomach.  It feels very close to the surface and hurts when I push on it. It doesn't really feel like the way acid does when it trickles up into the esophagus. The pain worsens when I have gas and eases up when that passes. It's dull and honestly easy enough to just work through, but the fact that I've been having it almost every day for a couple of weeks now concerns me.

Doesn't hurt to breathe. Just this dull ache ranging from annoying to actually kind of ouch, but still not enough to vocalise about. Just concerning because it keeps happening.

I used to drink a couple beers every night but now have since eliminated that to see if it makes a difference (I can't tell if it helps. Feels the same as when I drank every night.) 

Is it possible that this is just acid reflux and that it can feel different from the hot burning feeling in the heart area?

Does this sound more like an ulcer?

For what it's worth, I think I'm in fairly good health—just underweight (95lbs, 5'4"", Female) with no family history of cancer (but I recently learned I have a family history of gall bladder problems.) Mildly sedentary activity levels (work a desk job and tend to spend a lot of time writing at my computer while at home.)

First time I went I had a panic attack but got through it after 5 minutes, and they didn’t put headphones on my head under the coil (it’s like a head cage), which made me feel less trapped. I had to have a second MRI last month and I started crying as soon as I saw the machine, then when it came to having the coil and headphones on I had another panic attack. The first time I was on my own and didn’t properly recall that the headphones were a problem. I couldn’t do the second MRI. 

I’m going in to try again this Thursday and my GP prescribed me Diazepam. He didn’t really tell me what it will do to me in detail, just said it will make me less anxious.

Edit: I had the MRI! I made it through I am genuinely so proud of myself. I thought I’d share the experience in case anyone has a similar question and ends up here. 

Took one 5mg tablet an hour before the scan. I’m about 5 minutes I started feeling tired like I’d got up way too early or stayed up too late. 45 minutes later I was feeling really tired and a bit zoned like I’d had alcohol, drunk without the sick feeling. I got to the appointment and was a bit slow answering questions, mental lag sort of thing. Then in the machine I didn’t panic, I did feel the start of panic but it was very easily tampered down, like it was just a thought. The mri went well, got home and went sleep for 3 hours woke up tired still and a little bit sick, and then have slowly woken up more through the day. Thank you for all the comments it really helped my nerves.",Anxiety

49945,"antipsychotics seem like a bit much been depressed for a while, had first ""manic"" episode a few months ago but doesn't seem that intense compared to other people's here. I was on an SNRI at the time that my psychiatrist stopped.

now I'm in full depression again, but he wants to put me on antipsychotics and I feel like that's a lot/dont wanna do it especially considering the side effects!!

but SNRI's are off limits because of triggering the mania, SSRIs and Wellbutrin haven't worked, I'm on lamictal and that hasn't worked, kind of running out of options.

I'd rather go unmedicated than doing the antipsychotics (Abilify in this case). I don't feel like I'm ""psychotic,"" even in my mania it was barely psychotic--feeling like I could feel objects emotions. 

I started crying in the psychiatry office because I feel so bad about myself that nothing works for me and also that I might have to take some drug that leads to decreased brain volume and weight gain, hair loss, dementia, Parkinson's, etc.

So: at what point do antipsychotics actually become necessary??

He never answered my question, but from my experience from being chronically depressed to being normal, this is what I can say.- Normal is being able to get up from bed without overthinking the day. it is not feeling like chains weighing you down preventing you to move.- Normal is being to move automatically: make a meal, brush your teeth, take a bath and not needing to will yourself to do these things- Normal is not being hypersensitive to criticisms, every comment, every gesture. Normal is being able to shrug these things of as what other people do without other perceive meaning.- Normal is not having headaches, tense muscles, locked-jaws, palpitations, gastrointestinal problems and stress induced signs and symptoms almost every day. - Normal is not being on the verge of mental breakdown. Normal feels light and having a clear mind to make decisons based on reason and not on emotions.- Normal is being able to sleep at night with ease and depth. Normal is not crying yourself to sleep from the things that could have been or for fear of what could be.- Normal is not thinking about death and dying every waking hour.- Normal does not make you feel like living is suffering. - Normal people do not think existential questions as often as depressed people do. - Normal does not feel like you have a black hole inside your chest that you have to fill with sex, alcohol and other distractions.

And yeah let us not forget the time my mom violently beat down the door in a fit of rage where my dad had to take me and we had to hide in the closet and the police had to show up.

I went to college even it is my root because of fear and depression just because she asked me to.I never do bad stuff or creating problems. I always help her when she asked although with occasional satire remark, I delivered.I contain all my shitty feeling to myself, not wanting to burden her with it.And yet, it is not enough.

22943,"Hi everyone.&amp;#x200B;I have been struggling to cope with this pain for the longest time possible. I will try to make this as short and easy to read and understand as possible...My entire family is a train wreck. I live with my divorced mom and sister, both that are extremely religious and have expressed multiple times that they do not like me as I do not share the religious views as them. I have depression and a lot of issues going on in my life. Whenever I try to talk to them about it, they tell me to pray. there is so much bad going on between me and them that they feel more like strangers than them. I feel no love from them for many other reasons too.But that is okay...because I used to have my friends whom I have practically known for half of my life, yes, HALF of my life... Like, over a decade. I have considered them to be my closest friends and even family. I loved them more than my own family and will put my life on the line for them. I was proud to have them. Basically, they mean everything to me. Back when I was a child, I had a dream of owning a Ferrari one day but that slowly fizzled away into me meeting them one day. Yes, they lived overseas. I felt like my life had a purpose. I can continue on my miserable existence thanks to them because I was truly happy being around them.But one fateful day, I have made a grave mistake 2-3 years before as I speak, unaware it is bad despite and not thinking twice because I was just that passionate and excited to have a brand new friend and ""family"" with me. One day, one of them turned their back on me and accused me of doing something illegal that I have done that was not illegal anyway...and instead of hearing me out and believing in me, they chose the decision to banish me. Never wanting to do LITERALLY anything to do with me. I was blocked, blacklisted, and just exiled from their life. Erased. Despite me coming back 7 months to apologize, they still ignored me and want me out of their life. The people whom I thought see me the same way as I did, just left me. I felt so...betrayed and lost. Crushed. I feel like I cannot trust anyone now because if they can do this to me, anyone will. I feel like I have lost everything. No purpose. No nothing. I have a good job that pays extremely well, but that does not make me happy at all. I had one dream and wish and it was gone. I was already suicidal before, but this just...gives me a bigger reason that I am not worth being around. If the people I would put my life ahead and would do anything for turns their back on me and my family are as helpful as a plumber trying to fix an airplane, then I just do not see the point any longer. My family does not care too much when I asked them about suicidal thoughts but to pray and they are still on god's side... People say move on, it will be better but I just do not think they understand... I just cannot take it any longer... Everyday I am slowly considering that its just a good idea to move on by not breathing... Help... I feel like there is no purpose in my life anymore...",Suicidal

My libido has gone in the toilet the last year or so. My doc says could be the dopamine being suppressed. So now he's added Wellbutrin to the mix. It's been only one day but I've gotta say I'm getting really sick of these meds and the side effects. I really hope my sexdrive comes back. If it doesn't I think I may consider just white knuckling it and getting off all this crap. I've been on meds since 2001. Started with Risperdal.
Hate that crap. I swear my fingers got fat on that stuff. Has anyone been through this low libido stuff ? Is there any hope ? Has anyone been on an antipsychotic and had wellbutrin added to the mix ? What were the results. Looking for any kind of advice or input. Thanks

I am tired of constantly being the lighting rod of being looked down up and seen as a bad person when I am reality all I get is nothing but negative comments like racist or sexist slurs towards me or not supporting a belief or having doubts on an opinion. Yet they expect me to roll with the punches and shut up. I should give happiness to others when all I get is mental abuse and insults. that is why I despise happiness. I cannot bare to see someone happy because it reminds me of how selfish people can be. Even people who accomplished something makes me feel like shit because it feels like they are flexing the accomplishment when I am miles from them. Yet they expect me to cheer on the sidelines. It saddens me alot to see people in relationships or get opportunities while it feels like my life is on fucking repeat by eating and shitting. And if anything goes wrong, it is always my fucking fault. Dog hurt there paw? My fault. someone is tire gets flat, my fault. Someone is about to be robbed? Well guess who is fucking fault it is. I do not even need to be involved and somehow, everyone loves to put the blame on me. All these traits that people reflected onto me just make me wish for suicide sometimes. But I am too much of a pussy to do that.

This is something I am not interested in and I had no motivation to do any of my assignments or work and now its come to bite me in the ass. Luckily, I got accepted to college in September for a program I think I am interested in. I could not find it in me to push myself to do anything for this, I cannot stop thinking about how disappointed my family is going to be knowing I am a failure. The only reason I was doing it was so it would look good on my resume and to make my parents proud of me. Its so hard to watch people I went to Uni with graduate, I envy their ability to put their education before their emotions and push themselves, I could not and now that is 5 years of money and time wasted - I just want to graduate and feel accomplished.

50012,"I’m just so scared and don’t know what to do I’m not sure how many people will read this, but I really need some help or kind words. I’m in a depressive state and haven’t had a manic episode in over two years now. (Some hypomania but nothing too concerning).

I’ve been having a hard time with work recently. After finding this community I’ve discovered that I’m not the only one with trouble holding down a job. 

I have a relatively high paying job for my area that allows me to live at least paycheck to paycheck with one pay period worth in my savings. I guess I don’t really know where to start, but I just can’t work my job anymore. I have this horrible depression and the job itself is very difficult. I have FMLA for my mental health and can take up to 2 days off per week and also have time off for appointments. I’m finding myself needing more and more time off, unpaid, and I don’t know what to do.

I applied for a much lower paying job, but I feel like it will be much better for my mental health.

I’m just so upset and defeated, I don’t know if I’ll start this new job in a good mental state, if I even get it.

I’ve considered short term disability because I just feel like I can’t stand a single more day working my current job. I just want to cry the whole time. I feel like such a failure.

I’m looking into doing a year longDBT program. It was recommended by both my therapist and psychiatrist.

I’m just having such a hard time making decisions. I know I need to leave this job. I feel like my body and mind is screaming out for help. It’s causing me physical symptoms like nausea and vomiting, migraines, panic attacks.

Please if you have any advice at all, I will appreciate it.",Bipolar

50459,"I got a stern reminder that being stable doesn’t mean I am cured I recently had to lower my lithium (under doctor supervision) because my lithium level was too high. I started to notice that I felt less numb. I felt butterflies in my stomach and a warm, fuzzy happy for the first time since I was a teenager. It was intoxicating. So I thought to myself, maybe I don’t need my lithium anymore. I never tried stopping it completely after ECT. This was a bad plan…

For the last few days I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time too. The overwhelming depression, self hatred and urge to harm myself. It was terrifying. And I found I was completely out of practice in suppressing those feelings. 

Back on my lithium… I am the first one to advocate taking your pills so I feel like a hypocrite. I have been reminded that deep in my mind bipolar is still there and still capable of destroying me. It was humbling, terrifying and discouraging all at the same time. Today I mourn the fact that I will never be able to fully feel emotions and will always have to be “sedated” to some degree. I shouldn’t complain because at least I have stability. But that taste of what life is really supposed to feel like and knowing I will never have it has left me in a bad way. I feel ungrateful for the stability I have and greedy for the way I used to feel before getting sick. I feel here is the only place where people will understand what I’m going through. - sincerely a very tired bipolar warrior",Bipolar

I have tried to grow plants for years, even building wooden planters, but then once the plants sprout I leave them outside where they get destroyed by inevitable torrential rain. I just moved and have a dirt backyard that gets sun, so I hoed the dirt up and planted grass seed after reading how to do it, but even in this area I messed it up somehow. I also bought and planted some already grown peppers, but I know I will abandon them to being eaten by insects or just not ever eat what grows on them. The only things I have grown successfully are basil and hot peppers, but I just left them without eating them until I used them up. it is reflective of everything else I do in life, really.

I used to cut and i stopped 6 months ago because i met this amazing guy who i love. He helps me through it most of the time but he does not know how to help me now. All through high school i had no friends and i was bullied a lot. I hated myself. I had been sexually abused and physically abused in most of my romantic relationships. And me and my bf have been working through my insecurities. But on to the real problem once i got into college (which i moved 6 hours away from all of it) i struggled to make friends. I finally made a few and they were very toxic people to be with and they graduated. This past year i grew close with a small group of friends. I got into this relationship and at first they were upset cuz i did not hang out as much but they grew to like him. Me and him had a major fight i did not want to be alone so i called my friends. They immediately blamed my boyfriend and said it was all his fault. I started the fight it was all my fault and i explained that to them but in their eyes he did all the wrong. Later that night he proposed to me and i said yes (theirs no ring yet so we agreed on just still saying bf and gf until there is a ring). This upset my friends again and they did not like the fact i was still with him.Its a month past that fight and all of my so called friends went camping without me. I never got an invite but someone who they barely hang with did which kind of makes it hurt a lot more. And they have been posting on their storys about going out and drinking and doing karaoke all of which I have never been invited to this past month. Which really hurts but it also made me realise something. I have never been to a Halloween party but they all went to one this past year. They all planned each others birthdays and we did nothing for my 21st because i did not put it together. Shortly after the fight one of them turned 21 and they did not plan it but i also was not invited and got told the line on it was just a last minute thing so not everyone was invited. I saw all their storys and i was the only one not there. All of this hit me really hard when i thought about how i was never really invited and if i was it was always last minute. And i also thought about how this is our senior year and Ill have to see them every day in classes and work with them because We are all theatre majors. I do not know what to do anymore because i cannot cut myself I am 6 months sober. And i do not want to drink or smoke to forget and have another addiction.

17463,"At first i did not know what it was, i just felt empty, sad, lost interest in all of my hobbies, nothing was fun to do anymore. I did not take it seriously, ""probably just your teenager hormones messing around"" i told myself.I began searching on the internet for weeks and i eventually understood what it was, fucking depression that is. Probably caused from many years of extreme shyness, social anxiety and self isolation, i was scared of people and i had no personality.I failed highschool 3 times, it took me 6 years to finish highschool. In my 5th year of highschool (19-20) years old) i only had 4 subject to finish, so i had pretty much 80% of free time the whole year. I promised myself i would get a job and actually be someone, do something with my life. I failed, got called for 6 interviews and i did not even attend 4 of them (huge panic attacks), last 2 were on a more discrete place with less people around so i eventually had the guts to go inside, first one i had a panic attack right at the beginning, interviewer seemed cool about it at let me take some deep breaths, i went through the interview but he said at the end ""I am sorry, but you should really consider seeking a therapist"". Last interview, i did sweat a lot, i had a very shaky voice, i was extremely anxious and could barely look at her in the eyes, 5 minutes into the interview she says ""you are not really qualified for this job, I am sorry"" and i left.After that day i hit the rock bottom, a few months later i rested my forehead on a loaded shotgun for more than an hour, trying to get the courage to pull the trigger but the only thing that came to my mind was my mom's reaction seeing me dead with my head blown out. I could not do it.Last year of highschool, only 1 subject left and again, could not even apply for a job, my anxiety was getting worse and so was my depression. One day at 5 in the morning i decided, this is it, I am going to end it right now. I got into my car and drove to the nearest cliff by the sea (huge 100m drop), i just sat there on the edge for about 20 minutes trying to find a reason not to do it, once again the only thing that i could think of was my mom's reaction. Eventually an old fisherman saw me and called the police, i kind of got away saying i enjoyed sitting while looking at the sea and i do it nearly every morning.Got into university at 21 years old, 2 years went by and just being occupied with something eventually kept my mind busy and suicide thoughts went away for once. Nowadays, 23 years old, 2 years of university went by, still never had a GF (or even a female friend), i made 0 friends, i still have 0 experience talking with women (i have not had a female classmate since i was 16). I promised myself that university would change my life just like it does to many people, once again, i failed myself (my social interactions got a lot better and people do not notice that much that I am weird, but I am still shy as fuck).Summer holidays just began, depression is growing again at a fast rate, no one to go out with, i have 3 friends from highschool but we go out like once a month at best, my closest friend just got a GF so he only talks to me like once a week just for regular stuff. 2 weeks ago i spent most of the time searching for ways to peacefully kill myself without making too much of a mess, i planned to jump of a 75m bridge into the water or maybe try again the 100m cliff, and also thought about taking a bunch of sleeping pills, go into my car and and let a butane gas cylinder open inside...

About one year ago I posted here about my MS worries.

So here is my short story (longer in previous post):

October 2017
- nausea, dizziness, 14 days headache around right temple and behind eye, fatique, weak legs, twitching all around my body (eyelids, around mouth the most, tinnitus, burning sensations (especially in right foot) etc..
Then I started googling which was the dumbest idea in my whole life..
November 2017
- sensation lost around left knee
- MRI of brain/spine (1,5T machine) (few very small and absolutely non specified white spots)
- SSEP, EEM, EEG, EYE exam, bloodworks for EVERYTHING (lyme, hiv, syphilis, ...) and EVERYTHING is okay..

Then the problems slowly went away, but sometimes I still have dizziness, nausea, eyepain, headaches, tinnitus for few seconds, burning and tingling sensations, weak legs..everything is on/off

January 2019
- follow up MRI of brain/spine (3T machine) and everything is same as previous MRI

More than 10 doctors told me its nothing serious (no MS!!)  and it can be psychosomatic..

Im still conviced it could be something serious.

Got a GED and tried going to college only to drop out because of abysmal grades and horrible anxiety/depression.Went to therapy, psychiatrist the whole deal, it did not fix anything. Got diagnosed with ASD (basically what most people call Aspergers) and got on some meds for awhile.Meds helped a bit with the anxiety but they turned me into a zombie, effectively killing the last two neurons I had left.Dropped the meds and decided to try my hand at college again...it was pathetic, performance was even worse than before and I washed out a second time.Could not hold a steady job during this entire time either. I am so fucking stupid I fuck up even basic tasks. I have Worked a string of minimum wage jobs here and there until now and I have sucked at every one of them.Here I am about to turn 26 and I fucking hate what a pathetic looser I am. (I am a autistic, friendless, borderline unemployed, virgin dumbass who struggles to perform basic everyday human activities)My failures are not just academic and work related. I have never had any semblance of a social life either. Never had friends growing up NOT A SINGLE ONE. I was always alone, it worried my parents, they tried to help but clearly it did not. I have never had a friend, never dated, had sex or even had a halfway decent conversation with anyone not related to me. Every interaction I have ever had has been nothing but surface level politeness nothing more. Not that I would have anything interesting to say to anyone anyway since I have no life experiences or interesting thoughts to share. I have basically been a hermit for as long as I can remember. Everything feels so god-damned difficult and it produces so much anxiety that I basically hide from everything and every failed attempt at anything that want or feel that I should do causes me to sink even deeper into this hole I have spent my whole life digging.I wish I was like my siblings. Successful, smart, loved and respected. My parents would never say that they are disappointed in me, their love for me is unquestionable. I can however see it in their faces; feel it everytime they ask how I am doing or what my plans are. That tone of voice that tries to sound reassuring but instead sounds like they are questioning themselves on what went wrong, why I am the way I am.I do not even know where I am going with this other than the fact that I just want jt to be over. I give up. I am tired of being a damn waste of oxygen. I cannot stand another day of struggling on a shitty job, only to come to an empty apartment and sleep until the next day because I do not have it in me to try anymore...I have tried, for 26 years I have given everything I got and it always failed. My absolute BEST efforts are often less than other peoples ""half-assed"" rush jobs. I am tired of feeling like the dumbest person in every room I am in. I am tired of never being taken seriously. I am tired of being alone. I am tired of never having anything go how I want it to.Some of you may read this and think its impossible to actually fail at everything and yet here I am. The only things I possess have been handed to me out of pity by my family, superiors or just the occasional kind stranger. I have not earned ANY of what I have. It is actually a bit comical how bad I am at just living. My existence has an almost slapstick quality to it, the problem is that while that shit may be funny on screen its actually fucking depressing in real life.So here I am typing this while I think about wether I should buy Helium or a Shotgun. Helium would be peaceful and leave an intact corpse (less traumatizing on my survivors) . But a shotgun seems faster and easier to acquire ('Merica!) but my head will essentially look like someone threw a plate of chunky tomato sauced Spaghetti at the wall...

My mother and sister recently made fun of me for eating leftovers. I mean I waited until everybody got their share of food, and waited until the food had to be thrown away before I ate the scraps that were left over. How dare you hassle me over food, and stale left overs at that. So now I don’t eat!

My sister clogs the shower with her hair and my mother asks me why the drain is clogged. She asked me what did I pour down the drain. Like who the fuck pours shit down the shower drain? Every time my sister clogs the shower my mother assumes I did it. So now I don’t shower! Haven’t showered in months!

Recently my sister is cooking and spilled sauce and left meat all on the floor. My mother swore that it was me! She blamed me for days! She said that my sister wouldn’t/didn’t do that! It wasn’t until I showed her what was spilled was in the refrigerator still and was my sisters. So now I don’t even use the kitchen!

So, I don’t eat my moms shitty food, use the kitchen, or use the bathroom because she mocks me, teases me, and blames me for stuff!

My life used to be the shit. I was a million dollar ghostwriter on Bad Boy, Rocafella, Columbia and other labels. I did 5 years at a large university in NY, but I dropped out because my mom stole my tuition money my junior year

I swing between horrible depression and even worse panic attacks/spells of psychosis.  I used to drink to 'level' myself out but in the past 4 years that really hasn't helped things and just made the psychosis worse.  Also my current gf has a flat 'no drinking' policy.

Anyway after 6 months being on the waiting list at the ONLY place my GP would refer me too, I was given a 1 hour assessment and a script for abilify.  I have a long, LONG history of eating disorders along with the alcohol abuse.  This past 13 months I have gone from being a happy 78kg (I'm 6ft 2) to a huge 115Kg because I don't have my crutch of alcohol anymore.

I'm scared of abilify.  I just took my first dose.  I'm terrified of the weight gain.  When I was 16 I was put on seroquel and I blew up like a baloon which STARTED my crippling ED bullshit.  I told all this to my psych and he assured me that Abilify was 'completely side effect free' and 'weight neutral' but my pharmacist was flabbergasted and told me I could expect a similar trail to Seroquel?

My parents supported me in everything, my mom is the best.

Then I got meningitis and everything changed. I was never the same again. Started doing drugs to cope with my emotions (yes, weed is still an addictive drug) , partying all weekends with my friends. Xtc was just a normal thing when going to techno parties. It's the love drug... You feel so connected with others on xtc. Everyone was on xtc. 
Got addicted to weed for 20 years. Luckily I quitted with that 3 years ago.

My mom was always worried about me. Now she's 73 years old and still worrying about me. 
It's my task now taking care of them. But I can't. 
My dad is dementing. When visiting them I use kratom(legal). 
I feel normal and happy then. 
Me happy=my mom happy. But it's masking. Not the real me. If my mom sees me happy and positive... And yes... I notice that directly...if my parents are happy and not worrying... I feel better, I don't want them to worry. 
I just want her to be proud, she says it doesn't matter. I am who I am and she will always be proud of me. But... I see the difference, i can read and feel emotions from others very good.... More a curse than a blessing. 

Sometimes I can't clean my  house cause I feel to bad. And really.. It feels that people care more about that instead of me. The first thing they ask...did you clean. They don't ask... How do you feel.

So, if someone wants to visit me now I need to know it a few days before the visit. Then I clean, even if I feel bad. My mom can't visit me unexpected.

She wants to help me... I don't want that anymore. I'm not a kid. 
Masking my emotions with kratom for seeing people and not worrying them.. Yes, I'm not complaining about my life when I see them, I'm positive. And I really feel good than. So.. It's not fake... But In a way it's fake. 
It's making things worse. 
Not for the outside world, they see me when I'm on kratom and don't understand why I'm on healthcare. Sometimes I hear that others are saying I'm taking advantage of the healthcare system. That's very hurtfull to hear.
I realize I could have normal life. Just one dose of kratom.. And I feel normal. Like I want to be. 
But that's not how it works. 
Now, if someone wants to visit me I use kratom for having less anxiety. And yes, kratom is a miracle for anxiety, depression. A very difficult choice.. Staying at home for weeks or using kratom, going to a concert and seeing new people. 
On my YT channel I'm the most positive person. Making videos, talking, social. No one has a clue about how I really feel. 

My biggest fear is losing my parents.. And it's coming closer and closer. I feel so much guilt towards them. I can't even think about that. I owe everything to them. I want them when they leave this earth... I want them to know that I'm doing good. That it's not their fault. They don't need to worry. I will be alright. So they can go in peace.

25248,"I still want to kill myself and I still think I would do so at the wrong moment, but arguably the biggest point of conflict is the complicated relationship between my parents and my mental state.Parental love is a funny kind of relationship. I think everybody can empathize with the fact that most parents, objectively, spend more time raising children than anything else. Despite everything, they want us to succeed. They love us more than life. And still they can hurt us worse than this big bad world ever could. They seem to operate under this mantra that ""If you can take this, then you can be in the unforgiving world"" but it is so much different than that. The world cannot make me feel worthless, or like a burden, or like a waste of time. But you, my parent, have the only emotional tether that makes those feelings possible. Nothing I have experienced in every day society has ever made me feel emotionally weak. It is always those close enough to judge me and my lifetime's worth of choices that can bring that out in me.I am 24 years old and I just moved back in with my parents. that is already the worst feeling ever. I first moved away for college when I was 18, and despite some hardships was able to make my way up until about 2 months ago when my mom decided it was financially responsible for me to come back home. So that fast, my independence is gone and I am once again, no more than my parents' child. A 24 year old man. I do not know if you have ever heard about Jennifer Pan, but my situation is very much like hers was. Only I do not want to kill my parents. I want to kill myself.I learned in my psychology class that statistically, in men, suicidal tendencies reach their peak midway through the healing process, because it is where both suicidal thoughts and confidence are at their highest. Apparently I have experienced a lot of growth this past few months and according to my mom, it is undeniable how much better I am at handling adult responsibilities than I was when I moved in. I have recieved all kinds of verbal reassurance from her lately, because she knows how easily I get down on myself. She does not yet know how intensely I want to not exist, but she does know I have terrible self confidence. And on top of that, she knows that I am manic in a medical sense. So it is unbearably easy for me to transition from happiness to thoughts of death in a matter of minutes. Seconds, even. She does what she can to be a part of my healing but suicide is the one taboo that might actually help.But we cannot talk about it. The mere idea of losing me breaks her heart into pieces. She does not even like to think about me dying by accident, let alone from something like suicide.What she does not understand is that the only way we can talk these thoughts out of me is if she is brave enough to acknowledge that it is not about her. it is so convenient for her to have such a powerful shield because when she really wants to chew me out, she mentions my flaws, my mistakes, my mindset, everything wrong with me past and present. And all I want to do in those moments is to end my life, but she does not have to experience that part because she knows that I love her enough to never go there.More than anyone else, she can make me want to kill myself, but because we will never discuss it, she can suspend her disbelief enough to treat me like someone who is not at risk. The one thing I need to talk about, and the person who talks about everything else with me is selectively deaf about it. I love her more than breath but it just is not fair. Am I just selfish?",Suicidal

She helped to make me a people pleaser and obsessed with my weight. I do not hate her. I love her. I hate that I am not the daughter she wanted. She is trying to be kind now but it does not come naturally to her.

I try to visit my folks every 2 months to help out as I am several states away. I am very sad as when my folks pass, they are both in their 80’s, I will not have any family of origin. 

I get sad thinking about attending a funeral. It is not sadness. It is deeper. I do not think I would be able to get on a plane. I think about this  as my mom has let me know that I have to. I told her that I do not care what other people think. That is a lie. I do care deeply what others think.

I am crying right now. It is more than my mom being sick. I grew up being told I was fat and told that everyone was talking about me. I know she just wanted a thin daughter and did not have the tools to tell me she would love me just as I am but was concerned about my health. She would just use guilt and shame to make me feel bad. I think she wanted to inspire me with these tactics. She and my dad both had rough childhoods and did not know how to parent. They sent me to good schools, bought me everything I wanted and tried their best with the limited knowledge they had. 

Still crying and feeling hopeless. I feel that my life has been so much to please them. And I failed according to them. They are both trying very hard to be loving now. I did not receive hugs growing up and do now.

For me it’s:
- Losing sleep, (but not quite all of it—I have an anxiety med that increases need for sleep though so that could play a role)
- Paranoia about all my friends and the world around me
- Risky decisions in terms of conversations with friends, putting myself in a physically dangerous position, and the things I put inside my body
- Hearing whispers
- Feeling like God (and being pretty good at convincing myself I am)
- Sensory issues specifically with touch
- Making boatloads of artwork (it’s my hobby)
- Over-emoting
- S*lf h*rm, but not taking time out of my day to do it, just doing a project or task and being like “I bet I can h*rt myself doing this”
- Talking a lot and having something to say about everything
- Doing tasks super rushed and poorly

- Not responding to people because I’m in a thrill of art or work
- Leaving my house at any hours during the night/day

45760,"Relationships coming and going with the cycles (x-post from r/bipolar) 
*First off, this is a cross post from r/bipolar and I hope that’s allowed! If not, please remove!*


Do any of you feel like your interest in relationships comes and goes with your mood swings? I am shit at maintaining (romantic) relationships. It’s like my feelings for a person are *completely* out of my control. I’ll start dating someone new usually when I’m manic, and I’ll be borderline obsessed with them, and then my depression hits and BAM, time to dump them! Suddenly I don’t care about them at all anymore, and that scares me because of course they’re lovely people who have shared in great times with me. But suddenly I don’t want anything to do with them, get out of my life please, thank you.


I have managed to retain friendships with a few of these people, but the others I pretty much just booted from my life, and they were completely blind-sighted and hurt. I feel awful for doing this, but it’s like I can’t stop, and every time I date someone new I think, *maybe this time I won’t do it.*


My friends and family don’t take me seriously at all anymore. If I mention someone I’m seeing they make comments like, “Yeah, we’ll see how long this one lasts haha.” One friend even told me I should just stop dating altogether! I don’t want to give up on having meaningful romantic relationships in my life! I am human. But I feel like a complete joke. It doesn’t help that I’m prone to rapid cycling so these relationships can be anywhere from a few weeks to a couple months. I go through long periods of staying single and having zero interest in romantic relationships (usually when I’m depressed, but not exclusively - I’ve just never been very relationship-oriented), but a huge part of my mania manifests as uncontrollable sexual appetite, so I always end up dating around at that point.


It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I need a disclaimer when I enter into a new relationship! I’ve tried gently telling people that I’m a bit flighty but then they’re constantly waiting for me to leave and that doesn’t really seem productive either. I’m just tired of hurting people and repeating this cycle, but I don’t want to just give up on dating altogether. Anyone else? Am I alone here? None of my friends understand why I’m like this and I feel I have nobody I can talk to about it.",Bipolar

Since I started this I managed to pull out of my cannabis addiction, alcohol problem and get my grades up.

Last year I tried elvanse (active substanse lisdex(in swedish) amphetamine on two occasions and it triggered a full blown mania episode for a solid month. Like not even hypomania, mania.

Today I did the same but I could only get my hands on normal street amphetamines, I snorted around 0.3g of it on different occasions between 07:00 and 13:30, where I snorted 0.2g. The effect should wear off around 21:30. Should I expect the same thing?

I am very careful when it comes to this, and I know it's a bad idea just talking about the substance itself. But how bad is this, could this lead to developing bipolar I? I had a much worse deppressive period during autumn than I usually do. The same duration but worse and it led to drug/alkohol problems when I first started ssri without mood stabilizers.

I am certain this period was because the stimulant even though I only used it twice during spring when I didn't have any medication. But could this be remedied by just using this substance every couple of month and keeping my regular medications?

Probably because of my childhood and a lot of violence between my parents. (Coming from my father, mother was an angel) A father slapping his wife into the bathtub was not rare sight for me. Last year my mother died because of glioblastoma. It hit hard and fast, around a month after the first symptoms hit she died in the hospital. My brother and i decided to let her go, after she fell asleep in a operation. (do not know the right word, it was basicaly an 'awake operation' where they tried to reduce the tumor). She went into a coma afterwards and never woke up again.Now, I have seen my best friend, my mother die from that. I visited her as often as i could and felt like she reacted to my voice. A few days before her death there was none of that. She was simply sleeping, connectes to all the machines. I hated that sight, it crushed me. The day of the funeral i had so much anger in me. I was angry at life, at my father. She did not deserve that. I know that there are worse cases, i know all of that. But after all, she was my mother and my best friend. So much for the prologue. A month after her death i got a pulse synchronized (?) Tinnitus. Basically a whooshing sound to the beat of my heart. I got heavy dizzy spells and could not walk.

14252,"Today I just realized how much of a monster I have become. My vacuum cleaner went bust and my BF and I were looking at options. I was torn between 2 models. I wanted the more expensive one because it had all the functions I every wanted but not needed. The cheaper one was just what we always had. We got the cheaper one, and I was really disappointed. Of course I helped paid for it.We then discussed household improvements. Replacing broken aircon units, installing ceiling fans to reduce aircon use. Replacing a deteriorating refrigerator. Many other little things and big things. All, in my mind, pretty important stuff. Some necessary, some quality of life changes. But We cannot afford it.I am crushed. Despite saving for several years, I do not even have enough for my meds. I have been getting bare minimum wage for a job I have worked 7 years for with no raise in sight. People in my position usually get at least 70% more than what I am earning, but here I am, earning less than a fresh graduate joining their first job. despite more experience, despite more responsibilities.I asked if our parents would help even a little. Maybe help us get a good contractor they trust, maybe a little financial help. I got shot down. Specially by my own family.that is when it hit me. I have become an entitled monster. I want things, and I wanted people to pay for it and give it to me like I deserved it. I wanted to demand a pay raise even though I probably do not deserve it. I keep wanting more than what I can afford, spending above my means, expect people to do it for me just so I can be happy. I have turned into a monster. Like all those entitled Karen out there that think the world owes them. I am now one of them, I was probably always one of them.No wonder my mother called me an entitled spoilt brat that is useless. That I am a waste of space and should not have been born. No wonder that old boss screamed at that its all my fault, that I am useless and always wrong. They both say I will never be entitled to anything. I will always be the scum of the earth. I am disgusting, a disappointment, a monster. And they knew it. And now I know it.I am pampered and spoilt for wanting people to help pay for what I want. I do not deserve a pay raise because I am not good enough and will never be good enough no matter how hard or how much I try and do. They know I am a monster, and monsters do not deserve anything. I am useless, hopeless, waste of space and everything is always my fault.I do not want to live anymore. Everyone will be happier without me. And there will be one less monster in the world.I am going to OD myself with every single med I have when everyone goes out.You will not have to deal with a monster anymore.

Yet, when I need a leave of absence, I get told my job cannot be guaranteed. The funny part is this industry has horrible job retention. Well, it’s because they pay shit and treat you like shit and make you do the job of 3-4 departments but do not increase your pay and all the roles get looped into a miscellaneous tasks section in the job description. What hurts most is the way colleagues talk about people with mental health disorders like they’re an annoying object. “This bipolar mom…” “this un medicated dad..” “if they would just take their meds”. I have been in a manic episode where I had to go home because the impulses were going to overcome my civility. Why is there no room for me? I chose this field to help. Yet no one here wants to help.

And if I finished my freshman year of college not retaining any information; I feel like I am screwed for the next year.

12844,"I have never been good with Reddit, or even sharing stuff about my life but I will try to post something that is not a mess.I am not sure where to start because I have never been able to track the source of all my misery.I am a male on his early 20s. Raised by a single mother, never had any paternal figure that would teach me how to become a man.I am what you would call a peak introvert. I HATE talking to people, interacting with strangers, I am AWFUL with women even if I am not attracted to one, I still feel extremely awkward and make a fool of myself. I can make ""friends"" and conversate with people if I had to, but most of the time when anyone talks to me I can barely wait for them to shut up and stop talking to me, no matter who they are, I just get lost on my thoughts.I never had a girlfriend, but did met someone online not long ago with whom i established some sort of virtual ldr. We talked for years until she got tired of waiting. That brought me down even further. The glimpse of hope I had for a normal life, was lost. I get easily lost on my train of thought so i do not even know where I am going with this lol.But anyways, the point i try to convey is that I am weak. I am extremely weak and have always been. Every time i was faced with adversity, I would give up.I joined football teams with my friends, and when they stopped going or I started making a fool of myself during the games, I would stop going. I would give up at the first shortcoming.I dropped out of college on the second week because I had to make a presentation and i was scared to talk in front of the whole class. Who on earth does that???I have no passions, no hobbies other than sleep, waste money and time on the gym (seeing crappy results in strength and size), play videogames (just to kill time, even that does not please me anymore), destroy my brain even further watching porn and wallow in my own misery. So my freaking life is a mess right now. If I really cared, I know I could do something about it...but do I care? No sir. I do not care what befalls me, what befalls my family or what befalls the world.Ever seen that Spiderman web of shadows meme? that is exactly how I feel. My world falling apart but I am just walking right through the middle like nothing is happening because I do not care. I turned my back on God...I am no man, I am garbage, I am a worm, I am nothing.Am i seeking for help? Am i seeking to get out of this place i find myself in? Will i listen to advices? What can you do when you do not care? When you feel like life is always against you. That when you feel like trying, you try and then boom! you are immediately denied of any form of improvement, no matter what you try because you are freaking weak!Sorry for the messy post, English is not my first language and i lose focus very easily.Thanks. My life is falling apart and I could not care less",Suicidal

I have been asking like a week in advance to do something, he oks it, then suddenly he randomly invites someone else and they take over, basically ruining everything for me. Then this weekend is not good, how about next weekend? Next weekend comes and its still not good. Any shred of hope and happiness that I barely have gets taken away from me. Its not just hanging out with my coworker, its like I said, work. I get happy for a split second and I think I am almost at the top, then I get knocked down. I think I am going to blow off steam with my coworker and he keeps canceling on me. He probably never wants to hangout again but whatever. I do not care.

Nothing was set in stone but it felt like this weekend would have been a good one. But I guessed wrong. I hate my life and and I just wish I could go away and never come back!! I know I have other friends and coworkers to hangout with but I have different relationships with different people, everybody does, so that is why its disappointing when someone you thought you were close to blows you off and is basically meh and cold towards you.

Every day I can bend it a little more. My parents said that it’s happened to them and that it takes a while to get better but it will. I’m wearing a brace and taking pain medicine and using ice/heat. Elevating it when I can. Even while sleeping. 


When it popped out of place, it started swelling up, and the swelling went away about 48 hours later. Now it’s still a sharp pain and often feels if it’s going to buckle when I walk too fast or the wrong way. I can’t fully bend it because it feels tight and like the muscles or tendons are twisting up. And the pretty bad sharp pain when I apply full pressure is on the middle of my knee.

35212,"Worried I could have contracted HIV at work I am a nurse who works in a doctor's office where we perform minor outpatient procedures for skin conditions. I was injecting a patient with local anesthetic (lidocaine) on the back. While injecting the lidocaine, all of the sudden a stream of liquid started squirting out of the cyst I was injecting, but only while I was injecting the anesthetic. It was clear liquid. It happened to squirt right on my mouth and lips. I was not wearing a mask at this point. I immediately wiped the area, and then went and told the physician who I work with, as I didn't know if it was just anesthetic that has come out, or was whatever the cyst was consisting of. He stated that he would be able to tell as soon as he got in there to remove it. He injected more anesthetic and he same stream of liquid came out of the same location. He assumed it was likely lidocaine (the medicine) coming out of a pore. 

I was surprisingly fine right after it happened, but now I am so concerned about any exposure to blood borne pathogens (hep c and hiv, as I am vaccinated against hep b). I am not sure if I was exposed to blood, as it was only whatever liquid it was that splashed onto my mouth. I am concerned because my lips were dry and slightly cracked, and I had a small (very small) cut as well. Being a medical professional myself, I understand how those diseases are spread, and I don't want to be unreasonable in my worry. There is just a part of me that wonders if there was blood mixed in with the fluid, as I was injecting anesthetic with a needle and there was some small amount of blood on his skin from previous pokes with the needle, and that the cracks/cut on my lips could have been exposed to any virus. The physician stated he would be glad to have the patient and myself tested if I am concerned, but he does not seem too concerned himself. I know there is also no difference in testing the patient at this point or waiting to get tested myself in a few weeks, as the outcome would be the same. I am simply wanting to hear if anyone has any thoughts and wanted to vent. 

As far as I know, the patient was healthy and not HIV or hep c +, though there is no way to be sure without a test. This is my first real exposure to any ""body fluids"" in my career, so I am very curious what others think or to get any advice on how to calm my mind. 

I am already planning to get myself tested in a few weeks once the typical ""window period"" of infection has passed. I know having the patient tested would be the easiest way for me to get quick results (and relief from anxiety) but I do not want to offend the patient, either. I am getting sick with worry! 

Thank you in advance to anyone who responds. I appreciate you listening.

11053,"Originally posted on the r/suboxone, I thought it might be more appropriate here. But peeps, kindly let me know where it should go. AnywayJust wondering if anyone is in the sameboat. My story of addiction is a short one compared to many but this post is long so Ill provide a concise TLDR at the end. My mother (who I was extremely close to and saw every single day, even when I lived by myself) died suddenly in her sleep a week after my 27th birthday. As you can imagine, the word devastated does not do it justice. I already had been battling depression since I was a little girl, never without any relief (SSRIs, NDRIs, atypical, even ketamine infusions followed by sublingual ketamine drops. The only thing I have ever tried is an MAOI). They finally put me on adderall for several years for treatment resistant depression. It got me out of bed, made it so I could hold down a job, but if I chose not to take it for a day? Id spend the day in a blacked out room, leaving the bed and seeing the light as little as possible. The adderall made me feel horrible physically, moody, reckless but I was worthless otherwise. My mom was the only one in my family who ever knew any of this and knew that I was always a much, much different kind of little girl. It was s problem her and I tried to solve together but never could. I am the youngest of three. A sister 12 years my senior and a brother 9 years my senior. They both chose to never do anything significant with their lives. My sister was always a waitress and my brother was a bartender. I was the only one who attended university and built a career (as a writer despite this poorly written post). Its actually very abnormal because my family moved here from Israel when I was still very young because of the better schools. Most Jewish families take education very seriously but my siblings always had zero confidence, ambition, or passion. And my parents were not the type to push. In hindsight, they are like my father. My father retired in his 50s and my mother supported everything and everyone. She still paid my siblings phone bills even though they were nearing 40, lent money to whoever needed it. And and I am sure the financial stress she was under contributed to her early death. When she died, the bills and debt did not stop and someone had to take over. I was the only realistic person to take over and I did. But I was overcome with such incomprehensible depression and grief, I just could not work. And I could not lose my $75k a year job when I suddenly had a family to support. My sister was unemployed at the time and stayed that way for a year and a half following my moms death despite the obvious pressure I was under. My brother had recently had a baby (a year ago) so that was his excuse but he would not have helped regardless.To get to the point, I started getting prescribed oxy 30s by a doctor who ruined my adolescence and is now no longer allowed to practice. He prescribed them to me for carpal tunnel and they numbed me and made me capable of working. I knew I was making the choice to become addicted. I knew Id have to face it eventually, and about 10 months later after losing 15 pounds (I was less than 130 to start with) and when Id gotten to the point where I was spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on more pills, I overdosed after taking 90mg of oxy and 30mg of adderall. Well I had a seizure, I do not know if that is technically an OD. It happened in our driveway and when I came out of it, my father screamed at me for hours, saying things that Ill never fully get over. A month or so later I was prescribed buprenorphine. At first I thought I felt good because I was not going through withdrawals constantly while stressing about finding my next pill but buprenorphine totally changed my life. I felt like a normal person for the first time in my entire life. I was still more of a depressive than your average 20-something girl, still an introvert but I cleaned things, kept my space tidy and organized, I got promotions and raises at work, I had healthier interpersonal relationships, I went to the gym for nearly two hours every day for a year and a half. Two years after (almost to the day) of my momss death, I met the man I am nearly certain I will marry. He knows everything about me and has never once judged me. And for the first time, I know I can be a good partner who will not drag him down into my depression. Hes also on Prozac and is a bit of a depressive himself but it somehow makes us even closer. Hes about 10 years older than me and his wisdom about sadness and depression really help me. And we just love each other in a very pure way. It feels right. I have read everything there is to read about buprenorphine and its use in depression. It breaks my heart that more people cannot access it for this reason and that as long as I take it, I will have the label of an opioid addict, something that reminds me of the darkest period in my life. I recently tried going off and trying Wellbutrin instead. It was a horrible experience. During that 8 weeks I bought Xanax and cocaine (two things Id never had any addiction to or interest in but felt I needed them to work and sleep). My boyfriend saw the change in me and really urged me to say fuck the stigma, I am going to take whatever pill makes me the best version of myselfWhen it comes down to it there are people like me out there. Who knew from the time they were little kids that they were depressed. And they cannot find relief. At some point, although I have never personally had suicidal thoughts, I can see how people feel like giving up. Maybe this post is better for the depression thread, I am not a Reddit pro. Just sharing my experience with a medication that turned me from a train wreck who never felt sober happiness to someone on the precipice of engagement who derives pleasure from painting and reading and running these are things are never thought were possible before buprenorphine. TL;DR: Buprenorphine finally successfully relieved my treatment resistant major depression and has been a literal miracle for me personally even though it took going through hell to get here. After lifelong treatment resistant major depression, Buprenorphine changed my life.",Depression

Not a dream job per se, but one supposedly reachable, right?At the beginning of high school, I decided to learn Swedish and fell completely in love with the language, the culture, the country as a whole. My goal to be a regular French teacher evolved and now I would absolutely love to become a French teacher in Sweden.But it feels doomed to failure and it is seriously eating me up.Why? Well, I stutter and have other speech issues. My stutter is not that terrible unless I am in a stress-inducing situation, there it can get pretty bad. Even worse, I tend to... dissociate (? I do not think this is the right word) after a bad stutter. This is a terrible thing to happen as a teacher, right?I am also anxious, have very low self-esteem and my social batteries run low most the time. What if it is too much work for my apathetic ass? What if I am not good enough? What if students do not like me? What if they make fun of my appearance? Of my stutter?My anxiety sadly comes with scopophobia. I was never able, in school, to stand up and go to the blackboard. I was never able to speak in front of other people. At the end of my second high school year, I had to give a presentation with a girl of my class in front of three unknown teachers. I broke down. The girl, and I thank her wholeheartedly for her kindess and attempt at comfort, had to hug me to calm me down (first time I was hugged or even touched ever since I was ten, when my pet bird died, so this hug really meant a lot to me). Being looked at, or just being noticeable, at best makes me uncomfortable, at worst makes me freak out.How am I supposed to be working as a teacher in those conditions? Am I fucking delusional to consider getting this job?Actually, I thought about working all alone in nature, something like that. Sadly, my academic profile is literature-oriented so I have a hard time finding a formation open to profiles like mine. Places are limited and usually very far from where I live. Either way, I am physically not in shape and have a particularly bad spine (the wonderful aftermath of a fractured vertebra that had to heal on its own...), yet most jobs about nature require to be in pretty good shape.I have seen young adults, usually friends, buy a farm and work together. It would be amazing for me to have this opportunity.

We all were laughing and having a great time laughing and doing fun activities. But as soon as I got home one of them just didn’t want anything to do with me anymore.

(Making jokes of my diagnosis helps me cope in a way) It took me bit to collect myself but I’m doing a whole lot better with therapy now that they’re not in my life anymore. They were also very against seeking medical advice for mental illness and rather get high and not address their issues with a professional.

20503,"Heyo there!I try not to think too much about my depression but as of late it seems late I am going further and further into a bottomless pit of despair.Some background. I am 35 years of age and for about 10 years of my life well since about 20 I was living with my grandmother and taking care of her. Scrounging by and doing all kinds of jobs to make money. My dad committed suicide, we were not close so I was not too overtly affected by it. I got his life insurance policy so I used that money to pay for my expenses. It lasted me about 10 years and looking back I was pretty neglectful with my money. Anyways moving along to about 4 years ago. I apply for Federal Student Aid and that helps me out. I am getting college paid for as well as getting money to keep me afloat. There were a few close calls when I could not pay rent due to not having enough financial aid. Now to recent times. I learned that I no longer have any more financial aide and that my father before he passed ruined my credit so I cannot even qualify for personal loans. I have enough to last me through the year but after that. I have no resources to keep me afloat. I work at Target and I pretty much told them I need to work all the time because it will be the only source of income. But working retail is not very stable. I have no degree, no financial backup, nobody to help me and I am an anxiety/depressed mess right now. That and I do not know of any places aside from factory and sales that I could work where I make enough and is pretty stable. I feel like I am just going to be a giant mess with nothing and nobody come next year and that is scary as hell.I am scheduled to see a professional and I basically am going to see if they can help me get my life on track. I am old and I feel like it is too little too late. If anybody has any advice or anything I would greatly appreciate hearing from you!

(It’s summer here at the moment, we’re from Aus)
BF was kayaking, came across a fast-flowing current and flipped his kayak. He was pulled quickly to the surface by his life jacket. 
Got some water up his nose. 
He told me about it. 
I’m silently panicking and dreaming out thinking that he’s going to die. 
Here is a bit more extra information about the situation:
- water was fast flowing
- water was unpleasantly cold
- we have looked at the water from said river under the microscope before for unrelated reasons and could barely find any bacteria let alone amoeba 
- he has had water go up his nose as a child in a still, warmer dam (so badly that it went all the way into his throat) and it didn’t affect him.

I always find myself saying the phrase “that’s a thing?” when people bring up things I genuinely never heard of but apparently everyone else has

I seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life. If 0 is “I hate it” and 10 is “I love this and will skip sleep to do it”, the highest I can get is like a 7. Even with the things I “love”. Which sucks. Because often times people bond thru shared hobbies but you have to be passionate enough about that said hobby to actually fit in. And often times I’m just not that into it as the people around me. 

One simple example is when I tried playing DnD. It just made me uncomfortable because everyone was so into it and I wanted to be as well, but idk it felt like there was this barrier between me and having fun. And I get that it might not be my cup of tea, but like, this happens with everything I try

Or when I was considering my major for school. I ended up picking something that I had just ""heard"" was a highly paid major, without really thinking about it at all. I didn't bother to look into what classes I would be taking, what jobs it would train me for, hell, whether or not I even liked it. It was just ""ok, sounds good"". One of the most important decisions of my life, made in 10 minutes. And now senior year, I'm regretting it heavily and feel like switching to another career.

45485,"Maybe I should throw up my meds more often! /s When I was last at the hospital (2 months ago), the docs increased my Latuda from 60 mg to 80 mg. I immediately started experiencing nausea as soon as I took it, so my nurse gave me that minty Maalox stuff that you drink out of a little cup. They said that my body would adjust to the higher dose and to just give it some time. 

Well, the nausea didn’t go away, and I’ve thrown up my meds twice (last night was the second time) and experienced nausea and/or stomach pain every day or almost every day. They said to take it with food, and I did, but it didn’t make a difference.

I also got a phone charger that lights up for Christmas, and its brightness was preventing me from getting good sleep. I thought I could put it as far away from my bed as possible and not have it affect me, but it was still too bright. 

Throwing up meds + ? days of unrestful sleep due to too much light from the charger = waking up at 4am and completing 5 of my Chinese lessons, restlessly pacing the house for an hour straight and then doing 200 crunches nonstop. Mind you, I am someone who barely exercises so this was pretty out of character for me! My parents were concerned at first but then we all joked around about how I’d get a 6 pack and I should start my own fitness plan (manic state recommended but not required ??). I admire them a lot for their strength and composure in situations like these. 

Feeling restless and like you can’t sit still even for a moment without screaming is pretty uncomfortable, but at least I was able to get that energy out in a positive and productive way. I ended up getting in 5000 steps this morning, so that’s pretty good! Only another 5000 to go :) 

So, I’m going to put the charger in a different room (even though I don’t want to because it’s really cute :’( ) and talk to my psychiatrist about lowering my Latuda so I don’t have as many stomach-related side effects. I also need to make a commitment to myself to exercise on a more regular basis. I was going to the gym every day for a few days but then I got sick and couldn’t do anything for almost a week. I’m feeling better now so I’m going to get back on the bandwagon.

I have tried hard not to get into alcohol or do anything that might harm my body but i already have it pretty bad there anyways so i do not even know if its worth tryign to preserve myself at all. all i ever got told growing up from people who cared is that I am strong for living through what i did but it is too hard to get over those things when they impede my daily living constantly. i cannot go outside or i have terrible anxiety attacks, cannot work for the same reason. i can hardly buy groceries without either being in too much pain or suffering from these anxiety issues. needless to say the ptsd and insomnia make sleep almost impssible to come by and not at all refreshing. even just writing this reminds me that i just have too many problems and not a single solution for them has worked and I am tired of trying to fix things, using energy i do not have to do these things and try to live i just want to sleep and never wake up or maybe ill go on a walk and get hit by a car and die or something with my luck.

When I don't push myself to go into social settings and interact with others, especially friends, semi-regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to switch up my routine, it happens and it happens when I have no routine. It happens when I don't get enough sleep, when I don't spend enough time outside and the list goes on. It's exhausting. And while a lot of these habits/things are enjoyable in the moment, once I push past my ""but I don't wanna"" inner toddler brain, I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain ""okay"".And truth be told, lately, I haven't.

In my fall and winter semesters, I did great, 3.93 GPA and was planning on focusing solely on my organic chemistry classes throughout the summer. But before summer classes began, I took a job working in a hospital, since I am hoping to apply to med school and be a doctor at the end of my undergrad. The job was a 3 day a week, 12 hour night shift, and it fucked with my grades so hard. My job began at the same exact time as I started Organic Chemistry 1, and needless to say, I did horrible. My first exam, I got a 40%, and it only got worse from there. The class is known to be hard and the grading scale is generous, but I did so bad, and barely had the time to learn any concepts. I got home from work so exhausted that I did not want to do any studying, just sleep. I decided to quit my job before Organic Chemistry 2 started, and while I am glad I am no longer at the job, a problem that I did not foresee is currently happening. I really did not learn that much in Organic Chemistry 1, and Organic Chemistry 2 THRIVES on info from that class. I feel so lost in the class right now, and we have an exam on monday. I have been studying the past 2 days and so far, I feel like I have not learned a fucking thing. there is so much that I should already be expected to know, but I do not because of how poorly I did in OChem 1. Like I am so angry at myself, and I am going to do even worse this time around. I feel so stupid, and its actually important that I do well in these science classes. I get so demotivated whenever I join the online lectures because I never feel like I am understanding a thing that they are saying. there is so many vocabularic terms that I have never heard of because I barely got through the OChem 1. I am so sad about this whole situation, and colleges are going to see how much I struggled. I have already been so sure that I am not going to get into med school, but this is just making it worse. I have been studying for 2 hours and it is just been pure confusion. I am so upset right now, and I am seriously considering s\*\*\*\*\*\*.

I experienced what I think was my first panic attack with heart palpitations, pressure on chest, difficulty to breath etc. Since then, I have experienced so many different symptoms and sensations such as lump in throat, feeling of not getting enough air, difficulty to breath, waking up several times every night (sometimes with a strange feeling of fear), lately my skin feels like its burning or is sensitive, it also sometimes feels like my heart flutters, skips a beat or is just pounding out of my chest but not a fast heartbeat just very hard and powerful. I also experience headaches like never before, extremely cold feet pretty much all the time. Man, I've probably missed a few sensations too but this is really getting to me. I've had EKG, echo, blood work done to test my thyroid etc and all came back clear. I'm thinking about how I feel all the time and I am noticing every little sensation in my body and the smallest thing can set me off into almost panic for a few seconds. Lately its been more of pressure on my chest and difficult to breath thats been the worst symptom. On top of this, I had a cold for about three weeks ago and I felt a lymph node that was swollen, this set my health anxiety off into a frenzy and I can't stop thinking about it ever since. I can still feel the lymph node ( I'm touching it all the freaking time hoping its gone, knowing that I shouldn't) and my doctor said it was nothing to worry about, but as you know, health anxiety finds its way back no matter what. Sorry for all this rambling but this is really affecting my life. Do you guys have similar or the same symptoms? How do you cope or how did you overcome this son of a b\*tch anxiety?",Anxiety

11217,"Hi, I diagnosed with depression a few years ago and have attempted to commit suicide a few times before and luckily all of them failed. I am still undergo therapy in these challenging times (online) and it seems to get better. I still have suicidal tendencies but the frequency is not as much.I do not have much friends because I have a weird behaviour and some people do not like that I am someone with mental health issue. I like to make jokes to make people happy, when I see people happy, I become happy. But sadly not everyone like my jokes. I do not make any offensive jokes but some of my jokes can be lame at times. For example, that movie was ""Egg""celent !. Some people really do like it and genuinely laugh.I also asked a lot of questions regarding social life and it seems to make some people annoyed and complained about me. The questions I ask are simple questions such as ""Do you think my shirt is alright to go to the event ?"". But people can ask me a lot of question regarding ukulele but no one ever said anything about it ! I once lash out before that why you guys get angry when I ask questions when I answer all of your questions politely. They replied with my questions all the ukulele questions are ""good questions"" and my questions are all ""stupid"" questions.There are cases too where people seen me entering or exiting a mental health facilities and people became uncomfortable with me, saying I am very dangerous. There are times where when I go somewhere in an event. The parents shield their small child away from me . I never heard anyone before and this really make sad at times.I have been with seven groups of friends across five years and all of them end up badly. It is always the game event. One or two people in the group dislike me , and other group member begin to exclude me in everything to maintain the group harmony.I do not have any friends now, and my family are miles away and I cannot travel back due to the pandemic travel restriction. I begin to hallucinate imaginary friends recently like I make two lunch and imagine I am talking to someone across the table, I am not sure if this is healthy.Recently my therapist got Covid and we will not have sessions for at least a month. She is getting well and just need some rest. How do I overcome the feeling of always being hated by one person in a group, thus making any group relationship almost impossible.",Depression

21929,"Hi everyone, I am kind of lost, it is kind of hard, I will try my best to explain everything, but I need you guys advices, or at least know what you think about all of this. Also, I do not know if it is the right subreddit to post in, but all of this really makes me feel depressed. I am a 24yo European dude living in a small town in France. I had a classic scholarship until 18yo. When I obtained my high school diploma, I took a 1 year break from everything, then did 2 years of college in language studies (English + init. Japanese). Those years I was living with my now ex-girlfriend. She literally did not care about me at all while I was driving further and further in depression. that is where I got my new passion, thanks to some YouTube vloggers : Japan.Life has always been boring. Where I live there is no future for anyone. there is no job opportunities, it is depression land, clearly. I am telling that to add the fact that I have always been seeking for a great life. School advisers and parents always made me understand that having dreams and stuff was stupid, that I had to be realistic, and choose a classic path. I was against that. Back to my college years and the revelation, I decided for the first time of my life to dedicate myself to this dream : making my life in Japan.It was tough socially, because people used to think I was a child loving anime and being delusional. But living in Japan and learning Japanese was things I took very seriously, I literally spent night and days studying the language, and learning about the country, the good and bad aspects, the social codes, etc... everything that I could get with the Internet.I signed up on some penpals websites, I was chatting around with some Japanese boys and girls, and then this girl e-mailed me. I do not want to say too much about it, but we ended up together, we already met a lot (well, not since COVID-19), and it is been 1 year and a half now. You know what? I think it is the one, so far. we will see. Anyway.I really studied ways to go living in this country, because it is tough.First I wanted to go to a language school, but I needed a LOT of money. I also wanted to do a working holiday visa but it also requires a huge amount of money. let us remember the fact that where I live, there is no job offers, and I am not exaggerating : the equivalent 3/4 of the population of my town is registered in the French work agency (those agencies under the government who deal with job offers and jobless people, that is just how it works in this country). So school and WH visa seems they are impossible goals to reach.A friend of mine already working in Japan had a job offer for me as a graphic designer in Tokyo. Guess what? I am doing graphic design since the age of 11. I have a professional level, I can totally work in this domain. So this friend wanted to recommend me to his manager to hire me when the borders are open.The problem is, and that is what I learned today : they were forced to hire someone else because the borders are not going to open until months. Which was obvious but I was still believing because, it was the best opportunity I ever had in my entire life, to finally quit this boring life in a small town without any future for anyone, and be who I wanted to be in Tokyo, with the dream job, living my best life with the girl I am planning to eventually marry one day.As I said, I was believing, so I was already saving money thanks to a 1 year help from the government (so 500 per month for 1 year).Today, the day this door closed in front of my nose, I am just sad. I dedicated so much time studying paths to reach my goal, every single path became a closed door. Is my destiny being stuck here to my parents house forever?I just lost every single bit of motivation, for studying the language, for keeping it up and doing things right for the future I wanted (and still want). Happiness is forbidden. All those efforts to be back stuck in the initial position, AGAIN. it is like seeing an open door, approaching it, and seeing it closing brutally to your face. I tried many ways to achieve my dreams, everytime it just failed. I do not know what to do anymore, I am just lost. there is my girlfriend waiting for me, we did not meet for so long, and there is my willing to finally start my adult life. what is the point of all of that if life keeps slapping all the doors to my face like this? And it is also about people around me : everyone were so hyped up for me to succeed, and I am just failing again.Today I wanted to read my books about Japan and study a little bit, then the news came out, my friend told me that they hired someone instead of me. I just spent my entire day looking at the ceiling, trying to not have a mental breakdown. Happiness is forbidden",Depression

This job has burnt me out so much and gave me panic attacks and I didn't see myself staying there another week.

34067,"I'm really struggling I've suffered with Anxiety for about 5/6 years now, however in the last year my health anxiety has gotten extremely bad. 
Everywhere hurts at different times or different days and I constantly think I'm going to die. Whether it be a pain in my chest, or a rash on my arm or even if I find a bump one somewhere.

About a year and a half ago I started saying  'touch wood' if I or anyone else said something worrying that might happen. Eg if I said 'I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack' followed by me saying 'touch wood' and then touching something wooden. It made me feel secure, like it made it not true and it wouldn't happen once I said and touched it.

However it then got extremely out of control to the point where any time I even thought about something happening to me I'd tap the side of my head twice (for some reason this was my new 'touch wood instead of trying to find something actually wooden) 
I still say it sometimes, but if I only think of something terrible happening I won't say anything out loud but rather say it in my head and touch my temple twice. I know this sounds crazy weird but I literally can't go a day without doing it now. 

My health anxiety is so bad. I've been reading other posts and I relate to most of them which really stresses me out. I will always go to the worse case scenario and I can't stop. I'm constantly getting pains in my arm or numbness, shortness of breath, chest pains, headaches, shaking etc. I know/hope deep down its my anxiety but I can never calm myself down.

To make it worse my boyfriend gets annoyed at me for 'constantly being sick' ie when I have headaches or even when I get a numb pain or something he usually tells me I'm over reacting which makes me more stressed and upset. 

Idk if this is even the right place to post and even posting it is making me super anxious. I just can't get a moment to relax. My whole life is revolving around my anxiety. Every single day I think of death and how this might be my last day etc.

How do I stop this? I'm really losing my mind.

Lately I do not have any happyness in things I do, I see my friends (I have only two) and I do not know, this is really boring, all in my life is boring. My friend call me to hang out and go to sleep at his house, but my dad say ""No, you will not go to this party, you must study"", my father always say me that I am a stupid boy, I am just a guy who just thing to do party. But this year I study hard and have really good grades at school (3rd of my class). But my dad do not want to give me free time. I tried to talk to him, but he is always working or watching TV, my mom have not time at all, she is always working. I cannot talk to anyone in this fucking family, I have two brother, the first live in Japan and have a family, the second is at the university, he is very asocial and never had a girl friend, he also never had a lot of friend, idk if he is really stuying or if he is in a depression. And there is me, I am just a guy who my parents always say me that I am stupid etc... I do not have a lot of friends (just 3), and I have noone to reconfort me, I never had girl friend too.

Some are looking into buying houses, most have great, high-paying jobs and I am still working at this bullshit ass job making $12 an hour (yes, I get paid less than a Wal-Mart employee), because I could not find anything after college other than bullshit sales jobs, customer service, or fast food jobs. I neurotically fixed my resume I do not know how many times and finally had to settle on this job, which is essentially a ""cattle"" job - where they simply hire warm bodies. I might be one of the few in my department with a degree. Relationships? Fucking forget it. Why would a girl want to be with a loser like myself? I have never had one because I am too socially awkward to even make eye contact (anyone really, not just women), still work at this bullshit ass job after college making no money, I have no passions, hobbies, nothing to offer at all.

7681,"(Idk what subreddit to put this in, so I decided to put it in here)Why is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic, people admire it? They are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. Such as being too sensitive, or too inconsiderate, too myopic, too loud, too shy, etc. In general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. People admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.Now, once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny, or too fat, or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. Not a matter of constructive self criticism, its now that you are insecure. They tell you that you need to think better of yourself. That your looks do not define you. ""Work on your self esteem"" or ""You sound insecure"". Why cannot I just peacefully say or admit that I am not good looking? Or that I am not in anyway physically attractive? Why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? I know and I am reminded everyday. I can see how I am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. I know that I have never been liked romantically by anyone. Why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying I am too negative or that I am just *insecure*?I am not asking for pity or for validation. I just stated a fact that I have observed about myself. If it makes you uncomfortable so be it. But you would be fine if I admitted that I was not outspoken, or a good problem solver right? I would not be insecure, I would just be someone who wants to be better. I am not insecure, I am also not blind. I see myself in the mirror everyday.

35547,"There is always light at the other end of the tunnel! Just a little backstory; I have had hypochondria that has steadily i creased in terms of severity, since late last November. Over this period of time I have been worried about; going deaf, having heart disease/dying of a heart attack, going blind, having the Hantavirus, having lung cancer, and the most recent one - skin cancer. Throughout all of my fictional illnesses, even with the consideration of how rare they are to my specific case, I continued to believe I had them. I mean heck, I live in Australia and there are only 15 cases a year of the HantaVirus out of the whole country. Didn’t matter. My brain knew I would be in that 0.00000062% chance of getting it. Although of this considerably unrealistic thinking, I still believe that deep down I knew I did not have the virus. Enter, Skin Cancer. Out of all of my fears, this one really stood out to me. I had an ‘oh shit’ moment where I realised my petty fears before where nothing compared to this beast. Due to the fact I am a relatively avid golfer who plays without sunscreen and typically without a hat, this fear was so real to me. Book the doctors in, a 16 day wait I shit you not. In the beginning of this wait I was fine because my worries were on other things. However, approaching the date I developed absolute chaos inside of my head. I head to google and establish... “Yep... must be Stage 4 skin cancer, this is the end.” For the week I could not attend school, maintaining the fear there was a long road of chemotherapy, doctors appointments and eventually death, ahead of me. Today I finally go in to the get the skin check. I was essentially prepared to have my life torn to shreds if I needed to get a biopsy, and then to wait for the results of said biopsy. Doc looks at practically every mole on my body - nothing. No stage 4 cancer. No risk of death. Just, nothing. Although other worries have taken the limelight of the skin cancer, I maintain a sense of happiness and humour about how much I work myself up. How much I google every single one of my bloody symptoms. Not just I however - we all do. This story was to simply let people know that there always light at the other end of the tunnel and I cannot say it enough - stop googling your symptoms.

If I had not taken years to dwell on it, years in which I have acheived absolutely nothing, done absolutely nothing, I might have been able to rest and find peace so much sooner.

14832,"To keep it short, last year in summer I graduated from my education. The time in school was easy to say pretty hectic, considering that I was suffering from massive headaches, anxiety and concentration problems. This could be reflected on my results in school, people would say that I was a lazy student and should work harder. I was very stressed out and, as opposed to the other students, I chose to spend my time differently after getting my diploma.This was a decision that I made in consultation with my parents. They took it very seriously and were very supportive and so I visited the doctor who figured I should see a neurologist. After a few appointments and a multidisciplinary research, they found out I was suffering from chronic migraine. At this point in time I was very happy to conclude that I was not crazy or anything, there was a serious reason to all of this pain I was suffering from for all these years.All of this time I spent most of my time in bed and playing videogames, because there was not really that much else I could do without overexerting my body. Playing videogames was like a nobrainer and it gave me the sensation of escaping from reality.Some more appointments followed up and I finally got a medication prescribed which could help me with the migraines. It was still not enough to get rid of the daily headaches so they gave me another medication called Candesartan... and luckily again, this reduced the pain by a big amount, but also the frequency of the migraine. I was feeling so much better now, but yet I was feeling that there was missing something.I was still very tired and bad at concentrating. Here is where I started to see a psychologist which referred me to a psychiatrist. This is where I get diagnosed with ADD, as of now I am still in the midst of getting medication for the ADD.Now the problem is, with all of these appointments a lot of time has passed. it is been a year now since the start of the sabbatical and I am still at home. I realise that I get a lot less joy from doing activities, but yet I know that this is temporary which makes me fight through this dark period for hopefully once and for all.In the beginning I did nothing else other than spending my free-time playing videogames when the migraine was very bad, but that was also partly because I was trying to avoid thinking about my area of expertise since I had a lot of anxiety of failure during my education and it gave me stress which I had never experienced before.Finally since a month or two ago, I finally started working again on hobby projects and realised that all of my knowledge had not left me behind. I was starting to feel more and more confident and until now I am developing a good portfolio for when I want a job. I am making a lot of progression on building websites and feel very confident, especially because my friends compliment me for my work.BUT please, this depressing feeling, please be temporary.

And the biggest punch in the gut is not that I have not found the right partner, but rather that I do not have a group of friends to make the day special with. I was my sister's maid of honor, and she had such a beautiful group of bridesmaids to spend the week with leading up to her wedding, who have been her friends for quite some time. And she and her partner had so many wedding guests to invite (even with a Covid-safe ceremony) that made the day feel so special. I am happy for her, but I have to admit I am also jealous. My depression has turned me into a recluse, and I struggle to name people who are close enough friends to stand by me at the alter on my wedding day, and how many people do I really know who would be excited to attend my wedding as guests?I know that weddings do not have to be huge ceremonies to be special, but I struggle to think of even a small group of people who would happily show up for me. Unfortunately many people in my family are toxic, and I do not have close friends, so thinking about my future wedding guest list is so stressful.

So initially I tried to stay off to the side at this wedding. Unfortunately I felt that by not dancing I was even more noticeable. Eventually I went and took some xanax to calm myself down. Once it started kicking in I was feeling good and actually started dancing with the rest of the wedding party. And i had fun. Why is this bad you might ask? Because it showed me how my mental illness was holding me back from enjoying life. I cannot take strong drugs like xanax often (it is for emergencies only). This makes me want to try recreational drugs which I know I should not do and are illegal in my state.So here I am.

27193,"(Starting my senior year of college) - posted in r/suicidewatch as well. September 2017: Body dysmorphia leads me to believe I have gynecomastia. Plastic surgery research occupies most of my time. Turns out to be basically negligible and a case that goes away if I lose weight (learned this much later on).December 2017: After 6 scheduled (and cancelled) surgery dates with plastic surgeons to remove the gynecomastia, my parents recommend that I see our doctor and talk about depression. I oblige.January 2018: After my first visit with the doctor, I start taking Zoloft 25mg 1x/day.March 2018: I up the dosage to 50mg/day. Start complaining to doctor about ""emotional numbness"" and taper back down to 25mg 2x/day.April 2018: I am at a bar and get cold clocked (to this day I still do not know who hit me). Clean mandibular fracture and broken in two places. Wired shut for 4 weeks after that.August 2018: Decide I am good and that I do not need Zoloft anymore (was also very overweight). Go off the drug and two weeks later, I total my '01 BMW e46 M3 that I bought a year prior after running a stop light I did not see. T-boned a taxi.September 2018: Researching that Zoloft weakens bone density and increases risk of fractures by up to 75%. Thought of ""if you were not on Zoloft, your jaw would not have broken"" starts to grow in my head. call my mom on my birthday, mention suicide for the first time. She says I ""cannot leave this earth"" in tears.October 2018: Meet a new girl, we become boyfriend and girlfriend.April 2019: I buy a penis enlargement device ""just because"" to see if I can get any bigger for my gf at the time. And mind you, I was not insecure about my size to begin with, I just wanted to see if it could get bigger. I ended up suffering an injury from doing too much, too fast that left my penis in a ""hard flaccid"" state sometimes, and actually lost a bit of length and girth because of it. This leads to a lot of anxiety and depression that I still experience to this day.May 2019: Depressed, I decide to start Zoloft again. 25mg 1x/day.September 2019: I go off of Zoloft again. Girlfriend and I break up.October 2019 - January 2021: Working full-time, met another girl around Feb 2020 that I dated up until recently. Things we just OK. Covid did not make things any easier, but whatever.February 2021: I approach a urologist about the potential of Zoloft ruining my sex drive, and that is the reason I cannot perform like I used to. I start doing research and come across Wellbutrin. I start taking Wellbutrin 100mg SR 1x/day.March 2021: I go off of Wellbutrin.\*\*\*Wellbutrin 100mg/1x per day continues for month-long streaks coupled with about a month off. This cycle repeats itself for about 3 months up until the middle of this past June.\- - - - - - - - - - -End of June 2021: I come across a bunch of photos of myself a year or two prior to the gynecomastia/Zoloft phase.

Not high this time, but I start reading about people on psychiatric medications and how it can permanently mess them up. I start thinking about everything, from how my dick is fucked up, to how my face looks different from a jaw fracture I suffered because I chose to take antidepressants (and how the SSRIs probably weakened my bone density), how I pissed away good relationships with good women. Everything.I go back upstairs and take my Dad's ruger out again. I look at it. This time I cry a little bit. I start to realize I am unstable and the only thing holding me back is that I really do not know how to operate a ruger, and the magazines are out (though there are bullets in the magazines). I frighten myself again, and put it back in the case. I cry to God a bit here and say ""I am really having a tough time here man. I do not know what to do.""10:24am July 4, 2021: I hit ""post"" here on Reddit, then grab my keys and head into town for my habitual coffee. Feeling a bit better after getting this off my chest.

And before that, as a child I felt different, weird, isolated, and alienated. I was 18 before seeking real help, when someone at my university asked me ""Have you ever considered killing yourself?"" and it occurred to me that that was not normal. I have been on most of the major antidepressants. I have been hospitalized twice. I have seen countless doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists and still I am in the same place. I have reached out to TMS and Ketamine places but have not gotten anywhere. I have tinnitus and have taken a number of blows to the head throughout my life but never been sure if its related to the depression. I have a supportive family and even a great wife and I feel terrible for relying on them so much financially and emotionally while not being able to make progress. My main problem seems to be that I do not feel like I am a part of anything that is going on. I do not understand what is going on. I do not know what I am supposed to be doing. Everything seems wrong and all I see is chaos and confusion. I am honestly trying my best to survive and thrive but it just keeps getting worse. I went to college because I thought I wanted to be a filmmaker. Now I barely even enjoy films or it feels like every idea has been done. I knew I could not network or assemble a crew or any of the necessary things I would have to do. The most I was ever able to do was to make wedding videos.and hire maybe 1 other person. I decided to stop doing that, got a job editing short promos for TV shows which gave me a portfolio no one seems to care about. Worked for local government creating media before getting fired for voicing concerns about noise in the office because I am so sensitive. Then with no one hiring me, I had to go back to driving which I have done ever since I was able to work. I used to think driving made me feel free and I could be alone with music, podcasts, and my thoughts, but now I do not want to be alone with my thoughts because all I think about is killing myself all day. For two years, I transported dead bodies which was super depressing. Now I work for FedEx and its hot, noisy, and extremely strenuous. Every time someone tries to help me with a job prospect it leads nowhere, to the point where I do not even want to accept the help. I have been rejected from so many places that it seems I would be qualified for. I look for jobs all the time and they all look really bad or do not pay much. And the process takes so much time only to be rejected at the end. I want to quit my job but only have spotty gig work to fall back on. I feel like a failure and that I cannot contribute financially.I do feel gratitude for the things I have. I have tried journaling, meditation, yoga, exercise, and plenty of the other things people suggest you do. But my mind stays locked on past mistakes and cringey moments. I beat the shit out of myself all day everyday and cannot stop. I compare myself to others, get jealous, and get angry that I cannot be normal or successful. And it feels like I am getting dumber, more forgetful, and harder of hearing when I need to have all my faculties working as well as possible. It just seems I am getting older and my life gets more sad and embarrassing. I barely want to leave the house because I am sensitive to the horrible things I see or situations I might end up in.I do not know what to do anymore.

11072,"So, let me take you back to 1989. I had made a pretty bad decision in joining the USAF, as I ended up as an SP (Security Police, pretty much a patrolman), did not realize my ADHD was still there and only controlled by a lot of caffeine, and depression had been lurking in the background. I was stationed in the UK, and was pretty much miserable. My Sergeant was a full-on asshole, as were his two subordinates. Things came to a head one night while I was guarding an ammo depot. I am sitting in the shack, trying to read through a manual to help me be a better cop (as it was), and that darkness hit me hard. As a Law Enforcement person, I was issued a service revolver. Before I realized it, I had it in my hand, and was putting the barrel in my mouth. I could not feel anything but emptiness and no reason to keep living. Cocking the hammer back, I sat there, and mentally asked for a reason - ANY reason - to not pull the trigger. At that moment, the faces of my family and friends flashed in my head. I realized that killing myself was not going to end my pain; it would create pain to those I cared about. I took the sidearm from my mouth, eased the hammer back, and just broke down crying. I told my C.O. what happened, and was taken off duty and sent for therapy. Not long after, I was discharged (Honorable) and went home. It took me 32 years to finally open up and talk about that night, because I was so bothered that I had come so close to ending my life early. Sure, life has had its up and downs, but I am glad that I chose to live. It has given me an over-developed sense of self-preservation. Yes, I am still dealing with depression and seeing a therapist.

45903,"Newly diagnosed, need to vent. Any advice welcome My psychiatrist thinks I’m bipolar II. I struggled with depression for over 5 years, but it was always manageable. Ssris seemed to help. Then last summer they suddenly stopped working, I had my first hypomanic episode, and everything seems to have changed. This illness feels like such a heavy burden everyday, and I have virtually no coping mechanisms. I had to give up alcohol and weed, as I was becoming dependent on the former, and the latter started bringing on paranoia and psychotic episodes. I’m in my last semester of undergrad, and seriously don’t know how I’ll make it to completion. I have to write a thesis which, as you may imagine,  is like fighting the final boss in a video game that I don’t even want to play. On top of my other schoolwork, I’m just not sure how to hang on. My psychiatrist has suggested inpatient care, but if I don’t finish school this semester I won’t be able to afford to go back (my financial aid will run out). This disease is new for me, and I’m scared. I feel that if I can somehow power through the last two months of this semester I can then truly seek proper help for my condition. Anyone have any words of advice/strategies to just power through the illness for a period of time?

First time posting! Anyway. For reference, I’m 23 and female, married, and a first time mom. My baby girl is 8 weeks old, and was 4 weeks premature. We spent six days in NICU, then 2 weeks later we were in the hospital with RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) for two weeks. I’m diagnose cyclothymic and have been for a year and a month after being misdiagnosed major depressive the year before. I’m on Lexapro and Lamictal and have been since January 2017, and I’m still struggling with a lot of rapid cycling and mental trauma from past experiences...now we have to add my daughter almost dying in my arms from not being able to breathe.

Now that that’s out of the way, I need advice. I can’t get back to my therapist until April, and I can’t change medications because I’m breastfeeding. I had high anxiety during pregnancy, and the anxiety has lingered, along with deepening depressive episodes partially due to loneliness and postpartum. I’m in school (online) for digital media design, and I’m trying to get a job working at home. My husband works as a teacher at a school 35 minutes away, so we don’t see him until later in the evenings.

Anybody have any ideas for how to manage the depression and cycling until April?

I keep going over a certain experience from the past the lasted for 2 years but it doesn't meet the criteria of PTSD, but there was mistreatment from superiors and bullying from other colleagues but it wasn't consistent, actually most of the time I was treated better except for some situations that I keep remembering till now. 

3 weeks ago I switched to a different SSRI and I started having symptoms like anxiety, panic, ruminating over that experience and feeling worthless which I think were withdrawal symptoms from the old drug (lexapro) 

I noticed that these symptoms come when there is something wrong with the medication or I am going through a stressful time.

I got a panic attack at work and my manager noticed and when I asked for some time off to recover they stalled and then they released an exit visa from the country and told me I would work remotely from my home country but there is no guarantee that they would keep their word. 

So now I am faced with the possibility of going back to my country which is going through a tough time economically and uncertainty about finding a new job. 

I am now back to the old drug I used to take and increased the dosage to 30mg with the Dr's supervision. 

I am not sure if the medication is not working yet or that I am going through a challenging time so I am having anxiety.

20808,"Hello, 23 year old male here. My parents had divorced I was about 10, dad had moved back to USA. My older brother, sister, and I stayed with our mother in Italy. We had a basically functional family. I guess my problems started about age 12. As it turned out both my brother and I were sort of ""gay adjacent"". Brother was 15 at the time. I guess we were watching porn at the time and we became physical. It kept going on for several months. I was more than okay with what was happening. Was it just fun, a crush, was I in love with him, or did I just worship my older brother? I am not sure but I never thought of it as wrong or rapey or anything. So one night I am blowing him and our sister catches us and immediately tells our mother and the next day my brother is on a flight to live with our dad in another country.I told my parents that he did not force me etc etc etc but they did not care. Molestation they said. Rape they said. Trying to gaslight us. After that and to this day I have not said a single word to either of my parents or my sister. Complete silence. I would talk to my best friend and my brother on the internet when we could. When we would switch parents my brother would already be gone on a flight to the other one, I never got to see him in person again. His car was hit by another car and he died when he was 19.I feel trapped, unable to move on from the night we got caught and what happened after. I have never felt guilty about what we did even though all this happened. I do absolutely blame the rest of the family for what happened, for taking my brother from me and trying to make him feel like he hurt me.So here I am now, living in the US, have a job, I have dated some but never got attached.

When I’m depressed I am in contact with my feelings, I’m completely focused on what’s happening inside of me instead of outside of me 2. When I’m “happy” I’m not in contact if my feelings, I get my happiness from external factor, in contrast of when I’m depressed I get my sadness from internal factors.

48832,"My life is about to change 5 days from today, my life is about to change. While this may or will be a good move for me, I am majorly stressed out due to this change.  Some background, over a year ago, the company that I currently work for, announced that they will be laying off staff at my location and moving operations back to a HUGE city that I personally didn’t want to move back to, so I chose to take my 21 years of service severance package and will be moving further west to the coast. This past year has had issues nonetheless, due to the company stalling our end of work date consistently, which was due to supply chain issues from the Pandemic, which the company didn’t foresee when they announced the layoff and/or work transfer notice. This “stall” has caused a lot of stress on myself and my co-workers with not knowing when we’d all be getting the axe. The company had us all dangling from one meeting to another, when finally, at the end of last May, they announced that our end of work date will be at the end of this August. During this year long “wait” with not knowing when our actual end date would be, the lady whom I rented my basement room from, took it upon herself and just “guessed” that my end of work date would be sometime last May, and basically evicted me out of the basement, however she offered me to stay in another room in the house. She did this so she could get more money from a family of three who moved into the basement last May from the UK. This was an annoyance, however I do get on very well with the family, who are really cool people. I did a massive purge and downsized a lot of my belongings, which what is left,  fits snuggley into my vehicle. I can’t afford to hire a moving truck or get a hitch put on my car and pay for a uhaul trailer…so minimizing was the way to go. With finally knowing my actual end date, I could now start prepping for my move further west to the coast. I applied for school, got in and start in September. My finances are “f’k’d” to say the least, I have had to sink ALOT of money into getting my vehicle road trip ready, and due to this, has left me very short on cash with funding this road trip/move. I needed to get a “temp” place which allows dogs, where the college is,  and seeing how I don’t know a soul in and around that area, I opted to book an air bnb for the moth of September and 1st week of October. This air bnb is pretty pricey. However, I felt I have no choice but to go there and start looking for a dog friendly place when I get there. I applied for another credit card but was denied due to a “fraud alert” on my credit report from 4 years ago when I got my vehicle broken into and my purse was stolen. I went and got and paid for the police record, supplied my passport and driver’s license as photo I.d, and got copies of them all and gave it to the bank where I applied for the credit cards over a week ago. The bank lady sent these copies to the department that issues credit cards, but they didn’t read her “notes” and see the attached files.  😑 the Airbnb payment is due this Thursday, and I was starting to panic. I asked a family member to help me out to no shagrin. 😑 luckily, a very good friend of mine has loaned me the money, knowing I will be getting a HUGE severance payout in mid September. thank god. *whew!* still waiting on my own bank to transfer this Airbnb money to my large credit card, so I can pay the Airbnb. I am hoping that happens today or tomorrow. I got a finally fix done on my vehicle yesterday, and while driving I noticed a strange noise, so I will have to go back there to have it looked at.

So it does not matter whether or not I am in my room all day because they are too dumb to tell the difference. Aside from all this, motivation is in the drain. Small tasks I put off for days. Then family asks me to do tasks they are too lazy to do (like cooking food for others in which I am not allowed to partake) and then when I am dragging my feet its always some form of criticism. Mental health is a hoax according to these people and I have tried so hard to escape my family because of how insensitive they all are to any form of struggle (even though they have all had tough lives they just like to pretend nothing bad has ever happened) and being around my family each day continues to drive me crazy. According to them I am a failure and I am lazy. Nevermind how hard I have worked over the last several years of life since I was told to fuck off by my dad the day after my 18th birthday. Never shall I ever experience peace Isolation and the struggle to do simple tasks",Depression

34118,"Kind of freaking out now ('heavy' arm, sweating. nausea) I'm 26 years old, male, overweight (5' 10"" 250lb), non-smoker, infrequent drinker, non drug user, sedentary lifestyler, and my doctor has been monitoring my triglycerides for several years (I'm a carb addict). 

For the last several days I've been feeling kind of off. I've had what I think feel like low blood sugar episodes; light-headedness, feeling faint, slight nausea/abdominal discomfort that got better after I had some candy. 

I've also had feelings of 'fuzziness' in my hands and feet that come and go throughout the last several days. Not pins and needles or even a 'static' feeling, just 'fuzzy'.

Today, my left arm feels 'heavy'. That's the best way I can describe it. I seem to have normal strength in it and it's not numb anywhere, just 'heavy'. It's worth noting that I sleep on my sides (I switch sides several times throughout the night) and due to the way I position my arms, it's not uncommon for me to wake up with an arm asleep. Is it possible for a slept-on arm to retain an odd feeling for several hours after waking up?

Today, I had my favorite meal, mom's spaghetti. Once I got myself a serving, though, I found that I was lacking appetite. I began to feel kind of nauseous and began sweating. Nausea and sweating combined with the heavy arm freaked me out badly for a while. I took some pepto-bismol and don't really feel nauseous anymore, I'm not sweating anymore, but my arm still feels weird. I was pretty close to deciding to go to the ER for a little bit there, but I don't know. I think I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor for Monday. 

This sucks. I'm on Citalopram for anxiety that was discovered after I went to the ER with heart palptations, chest discomfort, and trouble breathing when I was 19. I'm kind of a hypochondriac. Why does it have to be my left arm that feels weird? I could probably ignore the right arm, but since all the heart attack literature focuses on the left arm, I'm freaking out. ",Anxiety

I thought either my contraceptive implant was broken, i would do pregnancy tests and not trust the result or go digging through the bin for them, I didn’t trust a blood test, I thought every twinge in my body was a symptom. I thought I saw signs everywhere telling me I was pregnant.

Then, last week, after 3 CBT sessions, upping my anti depressants and travelling home to see my parents for the first time in 4 weeks, I had the first ‘good’ week since September. No tests, no doctor visits, plenty of exercise, could snap myself out of any dangerous thought patterns. No googling! I was so happy and proud. I even had sex for the first time in 4 months with my boyfriend. 

Then, on Saturday morning, my boyfriend accidentally grabbed my arm implant. Since then, I feel like I’ve spiralled back of control after just one week of happiness. I’ve resisted doing a test so far, but I swear my implant is broken even after seeing a nurse, I’m symptom spotting, googling, crying etc. My techniques to cope aren’t working.

I’ve been in a really deep depressive episode for a couple weeks now and I’m not doing great. I went to therapy this morning promising to be completely honest with my therapist, and I was. I told her I was feeling suicidal, had a plan, but probably wouldn’t act on it. I totally expected to be sectioned but she’s great and understood why I was saying I wouldn’t act on it. It was a good session but it left me feeling pretty shitty. Today was my day off so I didn’t really have anything to do all day so I came home from therapy and surprise surprise got drunk. I decided to drive out to this bridge in my town that’s known for people jumping off it and I kept telling myself I didn’t want to jump, I just wanted to take a look. I walked out over the bridge and stood there for a while and then I chickened out and went back to my car. I guess that was suspicion because about two minutes after I got in my car the police came rolling by, but didn’t see me. I sat there for a while and then drove home. 
I don’t really know what to do. I feel suicidal but I guess I’m not that bad since I decided not to jump.

The conversation continues but at this time the symptoms I have been worried about begin to appear, my ears turn red, my lips start to shake, my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time I start observing that the person I am talking to has now noticed that I am having a reaction. My voice start to tremble as I must make some type of escape. 

Shame overtakes me as I now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong. I abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person, this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head. 

Later on as days pass, I start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people. 

After sometime, I start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me. If it is a place of employment, over time I will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so I quit so I can start fresh somewhere else but I already know what the outcome will be at each new place.

No previous health issues and no medications

I purchased an older vehicle from Alabama (I live in northern Illinois) on March 3rd, 2018. It was shipped that day and arrived March 6th, 2018. On March 25th, 2018 I opened up the engine cover (It is a van) and discovered a large amount of broken nuts or acorns and what looked like mouse droppings (small, round pellets about the size of rice) on top of the engine, along with a few chewed wires. I’m assuming that at some point this van sat for a period of time (not sure if recently before purchase, but I assume not, as there are was no sign of a current infestation to the previous owner prior to purchase). Anyway, fast forward to me cleaning it out a few days ago with a regular household vacuum. I don’t believe I used a respirator (mask) for all of the time, but if I did it was a 3$ one that is made for basic things like sanding, not for chemicals or pathogens. I vacuumed it up for quite awhile, probably about an hr. My question is, am I at risk for hantavirus? It seems that the virus wouldn’t survive after excretion for very long, and assuming that the mice were active until the very day that the van was picked up in Alabama (unlikely), there still would’ve been about 2.5 weeks between then and when I first opened up the engine compartment, and another week or so until I vacuumed it up. Any knowledge or experience with this? Lifespan of hantavirus after excretion? I’m killing my self over this and my anxiety is giving me a bunch of “symptoms”. Thank you in advance! ",Anxiety

45509,"Well, I’m bipolar. Hey folks. 

After a very shitty year where I lost our house to foreclosure, our savings, and nearly did in my loving family (wife and two daughters, 13 and 10), I’ve  been diagnosed as bipolar. 

The psychiatrist has me on a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant for now, which seem to be helping. They’re still making a full assessment so we’ve got a ways to go as yet. 

My wife has been amazing — despite the shock of the foreclosure and all the monetary problems she’s stayed with me and helped me find well recommended doctors and therapists for help. 

We’ve been going through couples counseling as well to help us get on the same page — the couples counselor suggested I might be bipolar, which started us working through the diagnosis process and into treatment. 

My kids haven’t been told of the diagnosis yet, and we’re not sure if or when we will tell them, or how. 

Personally, I’m a little freaked out. I’ve already been diagnosed as ADD, which seems to also be correct, but that seems a lesser issue since I am able to hyper focus and accomplish a lot. Or maybe that was a combination of hyper focus and manic episodes. 

I’m having trouble coming to terms with who’s right now. It’s been a hard blow, and has fractured my self image. I’ve always considered myself in control of my mind and actions and now I really don’t know what I’m in control of any more. It’s been surreal and I’ve been feeling a little lost. 

I don’t have any specific questions at this time; I partly wrote this to just make the diagnosis more real.  

Any comments anyone can provide are welcome. I’ve got so much to learn. ",Bipolar

I just need to get this of my chest.During random periods of my life I have been experincing extreme obsessive episodes ranging in severity from seriously hurting a loved one to turning on a light. During these episodes my brain completely blocks out most thoughts except for those telling me to do something. A couple months ago these thoughts took a new form during an episode in that they were centered around me taking my own life. Up until then I usually disregarded these episodes after the fact, thinking that I was probably exaggerating, but I remember thinking then that ""Holy shit, this is not normal, wtf! Do not forget this."". I am currently not in one of these periods where I get these thoughts, but I am scared everyday that they will return, and that I will not be able to ignore them.

I’m on 100mg now and have been for 9 days. I’m not feeling any better. Just before the increase I was very nearly in crisis (low) hence the increase. Now I’m struggling to get as good quality sleep.

35560,"Could those symptoms be caused by stress/anxiety? Afraid of cancer I’ve been feeling really anxious about some things I’ve been getting recently. It started with sudden one-sided tinnitus at my right ear for at most, five seconds. I’ve dismissed it, since it seemed to be common. But then I’ve started to feel lightheaded for one or two seconds randomly, which led to more searching, and the discovery that one sided tinnitus could be a red flag for cancer. And thus started my anxiety

Besides the tinnitus and lightheadedness, I’ve also had some muscle spasms. Not really common, once or twice a week only, and it’s just on the fingers of the right hand, along with a  a weird twitching feeling on what I suppose is the median nerve.  What left me more alarmed though, is that today, my vision suddenly became blurry, accompanied by a headache, lasting for three or four seconds. Never had that before.

I’ve been very anxious about this, and I’m hoping that those symptoms are not that uncommon or at least, anxiety/stress induced. Should I go see a doctor, or just wait to see if it gets better?

Halfway through though, it basically turned into a VR first person shooter game where I was just a floating pair of gloves holding guns and I had to choose whether to spare this random guy or kill him in order to finish the game. Then I suddenly realised I was dreaming, and of course, I am just like everybody here and I think about suicide all the time, have not been happy with life since I was 11 or 12 and am in a nearly constant state of misery. So I took that chance to try and kill myself, started with shooting in the side of the head but it did not work. I just ""took damage"" because of the stupid I am in a video game thing going in the dream. So I took out a shotgun, held it under my chin, shot myself and I died.There was this brief moment that lasted no more than a second where I had zero thought going on in my head, it was all black and I has absolutely no clue what was happening. Maybe I felt what it was like for a bit but I doubt it. I woke up, but it was not one of those things where you jolt awake just before hitting the ground, I woke up like normal as if this dream was not extremely fucked up.Killing myself, did not feel like a relief like I thought it would. It just felt wrong, in some sick way, it felt too easy. I have known for a while now that I will probably never kill myself, purely because its too much work and I cannot even leave the house or brush my teeth let alone find some method of suicide. Now I know for sure that I will not kill myself. From that moment forward, I will just sit in hole suffering with no escape, and just let the world pass me by. I have no easy exit anymore, so I will have to just deal my shit some other way. Not exactly a better option, but I prefer it I think.If you are reading this and you still want to kill yourself, suicide is not all you imagine it to be.

But fuck it came back to me and I feel like absolute fucking shit. I feel disgusting and I do not even want to be in my skin.

20282,"I just feel I need this. I am probably not coming back here again after this post, but I just want to rant about things and have people that have a proper idea of what I am on about in some manner or other.I am fed up. I am so fed up that I am actually fed up of being fed up. I am even more fed up of the forced positivity. I know that everyone thinks I will get better, but no matter how much you say it, I cannot see it and it just comes across as morbidly humorous. I am only doing the mental health stuff because I have got nothing better to do, I do not really expect it to go anywhere or do anything, especially since every other time it is not, and never because *I* did something wrong, it is always been something or someone else that fucked it up.I cannot even go on antidepressants, rather than fixing my mood they just dam everything up behind a mental wall. it is still there causing issues, I just have no way to process it until it finally breaks through and I am lost to fucking everything for about a week.On top of that, I am just ceaselessly *sad*. Nothing seems to bring it on, I just have some stray thought and suddenly I am in tears. I have cried so much that even though I am not feeling better I literally cannot cry any more because I have just emotionally exhausted myself.On top of that on top of that, I have given up fending off the thoughts. I do not have the mental overhead for it. For a long time I was able to at least *know* that people liked me, and that I was not useless, and that I would be missed, even if I did not really believe it deep down, but I cannot do that any more, I literally cannot. Which leads to another problem, which is that I cannot trust my own thoughts. I cannot tell if what I am thinking is accurate or not. I can tell you that 1+1=2, but anything requiring even the slightest bit of subjectivity is completely lost on me. I could not tell you how many people consider me my friend, and I could not tell you how many people I consider friends, because anything I come up with is prone to changing based on my increasingly violent moodswings, and I know my brain's throwing out bullshit at me but I cannot separate the bullshit from the truth.I also attempted suicide less than a week ago. For some reason the most upsetting bit about that was not the fact that I tried it, or that it failed, or whatever, but the fact that Facebook decided to just swallow my suicide note for some reason. it is almost amusing how much more that bothered me than the rest of it. I am not sure if it is the fact that I apparently cannot do such a simple thing, or if it is just that my brain's struggling to conceptualise the whole ""kill yourself"" thing so it is latched onto that instead. It makes me feel even more dysfunctional than I already do that upsetting my mum (And I assume brother, but we do not really talk about that kind of thing) has less of an impact on me than Facebook swallowing the fucking thing.And yet for some bizarre reason, that I assume is some grim determination to keep things staying the same, I am still going to the climbing wall, I am still doing guitar lessons, I still get up and brush my teeth and shower, I am still booking my eye tests and following advice I am given. I really cannot puzzle it out, and it makes me feel like I am a fraud or something, and I am not *actually* that bad, I am just somehow doing it all for attention even though the evidence is in front of my face that I am horrendously depressed what with me literally having made an active attempt on my own life.If I am honest, without improvement I cannot see myself seeing the end of the year. I cannot decide if that is better than the current situation or not. A long rant at... everything. (CW: Some suicide talk)",Depression

I'm tired of living like this. Tired of living in general, and everything it involves — interpersonal relationships, people, politics, economy, thinking, expectatives. All that crap makes me feel like shit and I wish I could turn it all off. 

However I don't want to die. That would hurt the people around me. That would hurt my mom. And my little sister. And, unlike other situations, I wouldn't be here to (at least try to) fix it.  They'd be left with the same nothingness that I feel, but worse cuz ofc death of a loved one is worse than just my own personal regrets. 

So I just wish I hadn't been born. That my mom had had a miscarriage — that would've hurt, yeah, but not for long —, or that I'd never been conceived, or something. I wish I was a blank space in the Universe. Something that had never existed. A hole or something like that.
They say energy can't be destructed and I wish it wasn't like that. I wish I could just disappear completely from existence and leave no trace, I wish people would just forget everything about me so I could die without it being a sin.

And in a recent post, someone confirmed that they have a new group chat.I have been under the worst depressive period ever, after doing so well in 2019, and because I was not ready to socialize and talk about mundane things with them or joke around with them, I told them I will just be with myself for a while. They were initially understanding, and then as time went on I just noticed the group chat became inactive.These are the same people who made fun of me behind my back all because I privately chided one of them (my closest friend) for being so carelessly ignorant about Covid. For context, vaccination rollout in my country is slow, transmission is highhe is living with a senior who in the past tested positive; and his sister tested positive for Covid twice too (she works in the hospital). So as a concerned friend I would tell him not to go out unless it is essentialand since we have a super close bond I did not really think about me being overbearing; we have been friends for almost 20yrs and this is how we are to each other.Once during a call, he let it slip that on one of his numerous dinners out he, being the jokester that he was, made fun of me with my friends for acting like his mom. And that hurt me because it was a private matter, and now he has painted me as this kill-joy, paranoid person. And that gutted me.it is one of the reasons I started to feel distant from that group, and when they started to be cold after I told them how I would been struggling with my mental health, that settled it.I am sorry for ranting. But I feel absolutely alone. They were my closest circle of friends, top tier. And then I am shunned just because I am no longer fun to be around with.It feels like we are all in high school again when I would feel anxious or depressed, and they would choose to hang out with our other classmates who are louder, extroverted, and down to play whenever.Depression sucks.

51200,"How does one with AvPD even begin to entertain the idea of being in a romantic relationship? To me the idea of being in a relationship like that is the ultimate danger as the level of intimacy in that dynamic is as high as it can possibly be in life. It is just hard to comprehend myself being able to deal with something like that because the fear is overwhelming.  For this reason this is one of the hardest things for me to work on despite making inroads in other respects.

I have learned to personally engage with people in a platonic way, although I have a sort of mental dissonance that keeps most social interactions at a superficial level.  But it seems like that is not a possibility with romance, which is why I have not been able to adapt or understand how to even go about it.  This is why like many other posts I have come across on here, I have virtually no experience at 27.

I'm wondering how others have even begun to be able to make an effort to seek one or even be in one as the possibility of rejection and having to be emotionally open is amplified.  I realize that avpd obviously is an individualized experience and other social dynamics might be more difficult for others and this is not me saying that I believe those in relationships are lying about their diagnosis of course.

Admittedly we are very functional addicts but mentally it is really taking a toll on me. I cannot seem to communicate with her about this though as she gets really upset when I bring up a desire to stop. We often go through stages where we fight all the time and then go long stretches where its all good.

We have a beautiful daughter who is growing and developing incredibly well so far and I hate the idea of her not knowing her father. At the same time I hate to think of her knowing her parents as scum. Maybe if I kill myself it will shock my wife into cleaning up and then our daughter can thrive with a sober parent.

She helped me with my father and I do not listen that buying a bottle of water for me is not worth and it is too expensive anymore, so she at least helped me in some sphere.I have been simping girls since I was 6. I have not been in serious relationship and I have not had sex so far. Since I remember I used to have 1 friend, no more than just 1, who was often changing. When I turned 14, it was more difficult to me, so I kept looking desperately for anybody. At this moment, I have one friend who ""survived"" with me surprisingly long, because more than a year is a shock! For 5 years I can count on 1 hand amount of people with who I talk regularly even on chat. I do not go out more often than twice a month with this one friend, because I have no one else to see. It makes me lonely, and it made me addicted to ma******te. I resigned from all kinds of parties, because whenever I try to go for it, it is a disaster! School parties, parties in houses or in clubs, birthdays or anything else, it is always worse than i can even imagine. Last time I ran out crying to my car and I was sitting in there for 30 minutes after 20 min preparing for coming back there from the same car. I was scared and tired, I was so stressed that I vomit immediately everything I tried to eat, so I just drank water. I also completely resigned from drinking alcohol, in 2021 I am 100% clear. Since my 18th birthday (January 2020) I drank max. 10 beers up to August 2020. I used to be stood over by a lot of people on different levels of my education by age-mates. I was called ""fa**ot"", even by my father. I would like to mention here that I always was straight. I keep social distanced, because I cannot deal with people. I am boring and cannot make anybody feel safe because I am weak physically and emotionally. I am lanky but useless. I have good grades, but I am stupid.I am retarded on relationships sphere, but I am not dangerous or aggressive. I am werid and panic a lot. I want to cry in situations when there are a lot of people around me, like in theater. Because of that I would love to move to introvertial Japan, but I will come back to that later. I do not have any useful knowledge or skills that would let me become independent, so I am also addicted to my parents' will. I do everything so slowly and I do not have any power to live. I sleep 10 hours per day, then I go to my seasonal job, come back home, have 3h to waste and go to sleep again, it has some charm that I like. Tomorrow I am getting results from exams I was writting at the end of high school, which will tell me if I have any chances to go to university, but I do not have big hopes. I would like to be journalist or therapist, but I cannot deal with myself, so where is dealing with other people?I live with my parents and grandparents at the same time in the same flat. They are all far religious, so I do not have a choice when it comes to religion. I have to go to church once a week or I will get punished by for example more practicing and praying. They used to breed me together because my parents work a lot so my grandparents were substituting them. I deal with 2 different types of breeding and I must satisfy them all by being nice and kind and do everything they expect and want from me. I am agnostic, but I must pretend I am religious too. When I told honestly my father that I do not pray regularly at home, he treated me like air for 3 weeks - did not talk to me, ignored me etc.they are pragmatic and conservative so I sometimes treat them like they are dumber than me but they have 1 thing I am jealous of - will to live. I would love to sleep forever, because I do not want to take responsibility for my life. I would probably be already dead if I was not so scared of death, thanks to their influence. I do not have anybody who could help me with my hell, which I probably made for my own wish. I do not have power to live, people around me do not see life in me, I am pessimistic and cannot find any good feature in me. I am worthless and I get what I deserve.I find pleasure in fanaticism and obsession. Firstly it were cartoons, then anime, now whole Japan. I am obsessed with it, I would love to move there but I know that I am blind and I do not see disadvantages. I have the feeling like only there I can achieve my biggest dream - happiness. I would probably reject every couple offer from local women because I only find Asian girls attractive. I am more interested in their culture, art, nature, music and more than my local. Maybe I consider it as paradise because it is so far from my actual place of living, my family and more. Sometimes I feel it is achievable, but usually I treat it as dream which is impossible to achieve. I am so separated, but I do not feel any privacy out of my phone because of my brother with who I share my room, and we always get the same things. I feel like I were completely average, Grey person, but under tameness.The worst thing is that I got used to everything of that - not having girlfriend and friends, being addicted and obedient to my family, being weak, dumb and childish, to being ugly and scared of everything. I do not want to change because it is out of my control, I do not want it and probably I would not even have enough power to that. I know s*it and I do not know why I write this. One of my foreign mates from India told me to do that few times this year so I finally did that, but I already consider my life as lost. It all comes to time when I finally die but I do not even know if after death it will be better.I love watching scars, ravens, blood (especially blooding wounds and eyes) and I tried to write a novel in my native language. I did it and published it so I know I left anything on this world but it will not succeed. I am completely apathic and lazy, and probably any help would not let me live normally now, it is already too bad. it is all my fault and I know about it. Stuff like ""everything's going to be OK"" or ""you need to take care of yourself and keep fighting"" do not work on me - it is done. Any speciallist have not told me that I have depression, because I have not visited any forever and I will not do it soon, because I do not have enough money.Thank you for listening to me, I do not expect anything else from you now. I do not have hope, will or power to change my life, so it just depends on time when I will be brave enough to start doing something... to end this. My best friends are funko pops of my favorite band... really, it is comedy, not tragedy.I wish everyone all the best every time because I know how bad can life be and I do not wish it to anybody so please guys, if you are not that down yet, try!Greetings,B!

The air felt more airy, the grass looked greener and the birds chirping hit me as a beautiful song and not an annoying sound interrupting my thoughts.I did not stop the good habits but I woke up recently and everything was dull again the same scenery that brought tears to my eyes a few days before looked muted and weak.

49798,"I had multiple IG accounts when I was manic, just found out one account was public... this is so embarrassing + shocking Anyone have a similar experience?

When I became completely manic, it felt like I had to use different persona for a different group of people and also had this idea that my exes and toxic people were stalking me. 

So I had over 6 IG accounts. At least. There might be more because I also had THREE phones back then.

I just charged one of the phones I frequently used during the last manic episode and found out it has been public for over a year when I thought all my accounts were private. 

I am so embarrassed because I don't know who's seen it. 

Probably a lot of my old co-workers because I might have asked one of them who was my best friend to tag me on his account. Maybe my friends who left me during an earlier manic episode saw the account. I don't know. 

I cannot believe I left it to be seen by the whole world... I wonder that is why my ex cut me off entirely when we used to be friends even after we broke up. I wonder that's why some people randomly said - earlier this year - they thought I was taken to a hospital.

Anyway, I don't know if I will be able to sleep tonight. Now I am actually laughing out loud because this is just unbelievable. 

This almost feels like I'm in a movie where the protagonist is stuck in this limbo of facing all the crazy manic shit from the past everyday. 

Sometimes I try to be grateful for the things I still have. Sometimes I'm glad I finally accepted that I have this mental illness. But, today... this shook me to the core and I guess I do still care a lot about things I swore I could not care about any more. 

It feels like everything was part of this weird movie that was filmed... and it had no script, was directed by a nasty, unprepared, direction-less amateur director who wanted to see what kind of extreme things I could do or say that would not make sense to the old me.

And my bf tried to help me in a way I told him time and time again that it would not work.

I also did not have a job because he would not jump start my car because he was so afraid of me crashing my car on purpose (I would not do that).

He said if I did not get myself fixed or start doing more for myself that hell kick me out. So I slowly started to do more and take care of myself. However, we still fought constantly. I still could not get him to realize how I felt the way I do and could not get him to start my car. So with that being said I still could not get a job and he hated that. Flash forwarded again, last night he packed up all of my things and kicked me out. The entire time telling me he felt so bad for doing this but it all my fault. Then he got moody and told me that until I get better that we can only be friends. So I was crying hysterically and could not drive myself back to my parents so, he had to take me home. I had a bad panic attack to the point I could not breathe and my whole body was all locked up joint wise.

Everyone knows the saying, 'How many psychologists does it take to change a lightbulb? Only one, but the lightbulb has to *want to change.'* I think I am preventing myself from getting better. I feel like nothing has changed. I still go to sleep praying I never wake up. I still cry myself to sleep trying to manage my spiraling emotions. But, at least I stopped cutting myself every night. Or seeing how many pills I can fit into my mouth like its a fucking challenge. I am trying!I am stuck in a rut and I am running back and fourth. I want to fucking ***die***. I want to die!I wish I had the guts to try it again, knowing I am probably going to live. I want to die...People do not trust me. People do not love me. People do not care. I was so fucking sad and felt so abandoned, I tried to kill myself. Who cared? My mom, dad, and uncle. that is it. Maybe if I died I would be better off. Thanks for reading.

I should just do what that guy in sunshine cleaning did. But some bullets go to a gun shop and load it and off myself there. Or I would pay someone to do it. Hire a house painter on myself. Call the police on myself. I am a coward. Will just continue to walk this shitty life alone. What an absolute miserable existence. I am 35 years old and have nothing to show for it.

9182,"I just really want to get this out, and maybe please hopefully someone has some words that might be able to help at all. I am really really sorry about it being so long, I just need to get it outIm a 26 year old Indian man grown up in quite a traditional household in the UK, which means mental health is always a taboo subject, and as such I have never brought up any issues I have had with my parents. I think on some level they might know I have experienced issues in some capacity, given I have done a lot of reading on the subject, and done charity work for mental health charities etc. but a part of me wonders if their upbringing makes it obvious to believe that its a true problem that is not sorted with a hugSo I went to a good school, excellent university, had great grades, show great social skills as a front whenever I need to, had a good job, then took a two years out and moved to Japan, and now moved back a month ago living with my parents for the first time in 8 years.Something is wrong, I just feel so mentally fragile all the time. Nothing I do gets me any mental strength and I run on a rolling 1-2 day cycle of feeling ok then heavy and useless again. As a backstory, I grew up with no friends, a situation I actually do not remember as I have recently realised I have SDAM (Inability to remember anything than the most recent few years). Which I always saw as a positive, because whatever it was, it was in the past, and I am beyond that. From 18-20 in university I always felt completely mentally strong and myself. Then at the same time found out about some infidelity in my father, the only person I had felt close to until that time (excluding my brother), and the only person Id ever call if anything went wrong. Fortunately those trust issues were compensated for by finding my first love at the time, but then when I moved to America, this was compensated for by drinking excessively for that entire year, pretty much joining a frat and drinking all my troubles away for the year without talking to my family at all. That year concluded in breaking up with my girlfriend at the time due to further lies and infidelity from her side. Then back in the UK to finish my studies and started work for a few years. After the initial getting over the trust from my ex, these 3-4 years were probably the strongest of my life. I felt confident, over all the trust issues (or so I thought), regained my relationship with family and friends. I had a great job, a great house, good circle of friends. Just a great all round time.Then I went to Japan, and again, the first 6 months of my life were some of the most exciting, new city, new culture, incredible new career, learning so much about myself. And found love for the 2nd time, which happened to be during covid quarantine, and as such went from 0-100 which was the most incredible and comfortable 3 months of my life. As someone who people say, connect with them in a way they have never experienced all the time, finding truly someone who I feel that relationship reciprocated is very rare for me, so was very excited. Then slowly over the next year and a half that turned into a steady comfortable relationship. Were very different people, but somehow it worked, I think she slowed me down in a much needed way. Although my good times previously were very mentally strong, it was very high-functioning, and I probably needed someone who just lived in the now bringing me back to a healthier version of ""strong mind""However again through a few of half-truths and lies about the past from her side over the next 3 months, sort of put a damper on it, and made me continually question the relationship. The thing is this time round, although not condoning it, I can actually see the logic as to why there was lies, and in my clearest mind can see that we still have a confident future together, as there was no malicious intent. Long story short, the year since then has been a constant rumination of mental battles on the SAME issues over and over again, mainly trust, and whenever I get stuck thinking about it, it takes me weeks or even months to get over it and regresses me back into my worst depressive states. And although I do not know the true because, the more I think about it, rather than from the actual issues from the relationship, I think the underlying issues with my previous trust being broken in my father and first love have put me in a position where although I want to, I cannot just let go of the past with the new relationship, and I struggle trust again, and this just screws up my whole mind.These ruminations were kept at bay while in Japan, because I was still surrounded with the loving relationship and doing meditation, yoga, and surfing to keep my mind as clear as possible. Although often getting stuck, I found myself getting out of it much quicker. The only way it really did however was to almost limit the longevity of the relationship in my mind, to limit how much the hurt caused me to become unfunctional as a human Now back in the UK for a month and I am STUCK beyond belief. I feel like the same thought loops get stuck in my head, and I find myself going over the same thing, and the same conversations with my brain trying to apply some logic as to why I should get over it. All this does is mentally weigh me down beyond belief, and just continually ruin my day-to-day life. And now I cannot bring myself to do any of the things which helped, yoga, meditation. Everything just gets me stuck in a way I cannot live. I do not know if its the being back at my parents home after so long, the relationship lack of trust, the lack of job, the culture shock or just all of them. I think with my idle mind is the devils plaything, and most of all it seems to be playing on my relationship view and ruining my mind.Now my every interaction just leads me into a state of mental instability. Today my parents came back after a day out and told me they bought me some new bedsheets as a gift, but the prospect of anything new / surprise / out of the ordinary just breaks me, and I had to walk away saying I did not want it, half angry, while trying to hold back tears. Just crumbing mentallyThen all I can do is get angry at myself for acting like a dick in the face of a kind gesture from people who love me.I just do not know what to do, nothing I do feels like it helps, and I do not want to do anything other than stay in bed all day, while I am torn about putting on a brave face to my parents so they do not see it in me. I want to get back to the healthy self I was at any point in my life, but do not know how to do it.If anyone can read this and maybe provide any help, something to do, something to focus on, anyone who is been through something similar, or even someone to talk to, I would be really appreciative.I am really sorry again for the long post. do not know how to continue in life",Depression

At first I thought it was burnout from uni....but now I have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism, and now that I am graduated, I just feel like shit. I was an emotional mess back in April, and now I just feel numb. I still overly care about people and important things, but my mood has been so static. I am not happy anymore, I am not sad anymore, I am just....there? I am just so beyond tired. Past 5 years was so intense, with both school and personal stuff. I am an overachiever, my cGPA is a near 4.0, grad school is not too far. Career wise, life is good. I am at my prime, and I feel so confident in that. But in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. First dude I ever truly liked turned out to also be similar, and that led me to being a codependent chaser. My parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. My dads health has been steadily declining. My PCOS has shattered my self image and worth. My sibling and parents fight constantly. My parents fight with each other constantly. What are the fucking odds- every year I tell myself that the next year is going to be better, and I end up disappointing myself. Like, I can never catch a break. And literally I do not know anything about personal boundaries. I am so quick to commit to being there for people, but I have realized that I am never there for myself. Apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response, and that totally makes sense. Being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family, I learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. Being a therapist, peacemaker, tutor, caretaker for my family members and all that. And now- I just feel like I am passing my threshold of tolerance. And what is so fucked up about all of this is that I am on track to becoming a physician- I have to want to care for people. But I know that if I continue like this, I am going to end up probably yeeting myself before I even finish training. I need to be there for myself for a bit, but a night of simple self-care makes me feel beyond guilty. I feel so fucking lonely, but I want to be left alone more than anything. I am so fucking sick of shit, but I have to push through. I am trying so hard to keep a mental grip, but all I want to do is cry. Fuck, I need a hug. vent",Depression

34758,"Terrified of catching the flu after ENT visit. I've been a huge germaphobe for as long as I can remember. In the spring and summer it usually doesn't cause me to much distress, but once cold and flu season pick up, it starts to have a greater impact on my mental health and my ability to function. 

Earlier today, I had my bi-yearly appointment with my ENT to get my ears cleaned out (I produce a ton of wax). I was super anxious going into the appointment as there is a very bad cold going around my area right now, and the flu is widespread. I took hand sanitizer with me and was prepared to grab a mask if the waiting room was busy. 

Thankfully, there wasnt a single patient in the waiting room. I was called back quickly,  the nurse took some info, I sanitized my hands, and then my ENT entered the room. He shook my hand, and then sanitized his, and got to work cleaning me out. 

Once he finished I asked a quick question about how to avoid facial and ear pain on a long flight, and he suggested the vasalva maneuver. He demonstrated it for me, and then asked me to try it. Ordinarily, I dont touch my face under any circumstances, but since I had just sanitized my hands and since I was just pinching the outside of my nose (I was careful not to get too close to my nostrils), I figured it would be okay. So I pinched my nose very briefly and went on my way. 

On the drive home I started to think about it a bit more, and realized that after I sanitized my hands, I shook his hand, so my hands probably were not very clean when I pinched my nose shut. And I started to get really worried that in doing so, I probably exposed myself to tons of cold/flu germs that will infect me in the coming days. 

Now I'm anxious as can be, trying to find some rational reason why I shouldn't be worried here, so I can calm down a bit. I havent had any luck yet. Can anybody help me out here? 

Also, just for the record, I'm seeing a therapist twice a week to help with these things. We just started back in October, but unfortunately he's been out of town all of December for the holidays. I've backtracked a good bit in his absence. I'm also more anxious than usual about getting sick because I have a vacation coming up next week and I really dont want to have a cold/flu while traveling.

Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was Hispanic/Puerto Rican. They divorced when I was young (Stevie Wonder could see that one coming) and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish, never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican (my mother was Americanized) except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the pop-culture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failure/coward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features (lol) and I was sometimes teased and bullied in school/work because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned and has a foreign accent.

Hope you're all doing alright today :) 

I've suffered from overthinking and general anxiety for a while. Being in my final year of university has been overwhelming to the point where I started seeking professional help. My doctor prescribed some beta blockers to me and asked me to take them when necessary - I've not thought of taking them until today.

I think I hit my breaking point today. I have way too much to do and I haven't been able to manage things well. I felt some aches and tightness in my chest and throat, got cold hands and feet, and starting stress sweating (the smell was putrid). I could also feel my heart pounding in my chest. I decided to check my heart rate and I was surprised to find out that it was in the mid 50s. I didn't take my first dose of beta blockers and I'm waiting to speak to my doctor tomorrow.

24292,"There are different 'types' of being suicidal, and what I am learning is that I have discovered another type. An oddly beautiful type. A type I never knew existed. A couple years ago, I was in the stereotypical 'defeated suicidal' state where I finally caved: I admitted I could not do things alone, reached out to family, started calling the suicide hotline regularly, and slowly things improved. Before now, I would always associated suicide with feelings of hopelessness, sadness, anger, and negative energy in general. I wondered if it was possible for someone to kill themselves with the energy of love and bliss; for someone to kill themselves with a genuine smile on their face. Was it possible? Today I have learned: Yes, it is. it is a beautiful day; one of my favorite kinds of days. The sky is completely clear and blue, the trees are green and lush, I feel beautiful, I texted 'good morinng' my sisters this morning (we are closer now than we have ever been before), and yet if I had a gun in my room, I know I could easily insert the barrel into my mouth, telepathically tell the universe/god that I am in love with it and that I have enjoyed my time on earth: that I have appreciated every bite of pizza, every puffy donut, every sip of creamy, milky coffee, every agonizing second of being in love with a boy I could not have, every orgasm that felt like temporary obliteration, and pull the trigger with the final smiling thought, ""Existence, my love, I have total trust in you."" Who knew being suicidal could be so beautiful? I am so at peace. I am discovering that this is what it means to truly not fear death. To trust the universe so totally and with so much love that it becomes a bond-building 'free fall' with your best friend. I love you universe. I love you existence. I imagine suicide often, but with each passing day, it is less and less dark, less and less negative more and more full of love, trust and beauty. Because of this, I am the closest I have ever been to killing myself, only because now: I truly have nothing to fear. However conversely my imagined death with a gun exudes so much warmth and love that I no longer have to do it. it is like imaging yourself eating ice cream, and the imagined simulation being so good, you do not actually have to eat ice cream anymore. I am very suicidal, 'dangerously suicidal,' and yet -- I am also so in love with life and everything around me that I feel at a perfect neutral completely suspended in a space where choosing to live and choosing to die would be choices easily made with the exact same energy: the energy of love and trust.

On the surface, I feel like I have everything that anyone could ever want. I am a college student that is in a field of study that is reasonably suited towards my aptitudes, have a loving family, friends, and all the other hallmarks of a functional lifestyle.However, my feelings of dread are persistent and have plagued me since I was a young teenager. Even in grade school, I exhibited signs of clinical depression and hints of suicidal behavior that had no obvious justification. My family has done a wonderful job of providing me assistance during my times of need, and I cannot ever thank them enough for that. Nonetheless, I still feel this gargantuan, intangible misery draped around my weary shoulders on a daily basis.What I feel is not a crippling want for attention or unattainable goals, but a general dislike for being human. No matter how I weigh the quantifiable joy I have experienced in my life, it always seems frivolous at best in comparison to the weight of my sorrows. I perhaps feel so terrible that I feel nothing at all.On a primal level, I possess intense hatred and frustration towards my corporeal contract. I hate being human. I do not want to be me anymore. Why do I have to be me? The sheer pain I feel is indescribable, and almost certainly blocks out any fleeting pockets of happiness that I can extract from life.

I woke up and I couldn’t tell if I was awake or asleep. Everything was moving in slow motion. I had so much anxiety that it felt like my chest was burning. I couldn’t feel my own heartbeat. I was able to go back to sleep but I feel the same thing now, it’s been 22.5 hours later. My head feels like it wants to explode. I’m dizzy and off balance. Cant stop shaking. I want to vomit my brains out. So much anxiety it hurt so bad. 

I’m going back to the doctor tomorrow. they told me not to take the second dose. 50mg. I’ve never been on any medicine before. My body hates it. I just want this to stop please.

45785,"Afraid of being a hypochondriac The title says a lot. I saw a comment a few days back saying people with bipolar tend to be hypochondriacs as well. My first reaction was, not me! Now I’m not so sure.

I have a UTI with kidney pain. I know this because I have chronic UTIs and have for most of my adult life. I also have a bladder that has moved lower due to having four children. ANYHOW...I know the symptoms and I have been “waiting” to make sure it wasn’t in my head or simple dehydration before going to the doctor. Today is Saturday and thankfully his practice is open on weekends. I haven’t called yet, but I will when they open. The pain is worse this morning.

And then I realized that every time I get a cold, I recheck the symptoms of the flu, pneumonia, etc. in order to rule those things out.

If I get a rash, I will look up different rashes to make sure it’s not some flesh eating bacteria. I had shingles behind my knees last year and wrote it off as dermatitis and didn’t go to see my doctor until it hurt too much to walk.

I guess I’m sort of the opposite. I try to rule out worse illnesses? But then I thought - hey, maybe that’s how you justify it, but you’re a hypochondriac silly.

Except when it comes to UTIs. I know every symptom I’ve experienced.

52432,"I need help with quitting job This week, I started a construction job I wasn't 100% sure about.
My coworkers and supervisors are nice people but the job isn't what I expected.

Some tasks were understated when I applied for the job and in the interview but the tasks actually require a significant amount of my daily effort. 

Also I'm underpaid relative to what I was paid in my previous job as well as no paid break. However,  the job is 30 minutes from my house so cheaper public transportation. 

So because they're nice to me, patient, and welcoming I feel very uncomfortable telling them I'll quit even though the job contract says neither party has to give notice. 


Also, I've always been an agency worker and the idea of having to give 2-3 weeks notice provides endless anxiety. In an agency job I could just phone or text and say I won't return the next day.

I do not think my parents want to admit I have it but I know I do.I did not used to feel this way. I was a happy teen for the majority of it. Things only really started to decline when I was 16. I have had ups and downs but its remained pretty consistent. However its been getting worse and worse since 2019. Even before all this covid crap.I have a nice life. I have a loving family and two wonderful parents that I love very much and who love me very much. I have some pretty great siblings too. I have a wonderful and amazing boyfriend that I met online last year and who is going to come visit me in September (unfortunately its a long distance relationship). I have a great best friend who I also met online and that I love very much. I have a good job (it does not pay enough at all and its incredibly boring but the family I work for is wonderful and is the only reason I have stayed with it for 3 years). I should be happy. I have so many wonderful blessings. But I am not.I have only felt worse and worse with each passing month. The depressive episodes are only getting longer and harder to crawl out of. I never want to do anything I like to do anymore. I cannot get excited about things that usually make me happy anymore. I keep having awful nightmares about feeling trapped, cornered, and helpless but everyone around me says Ill be just fine.I know I am loved. I know I am worthy of love.

10889,"I want to leave something like a autobiography here, hoping that it will give context to understand how I feel. I also think it will be nice to look back. So, here goes nothing. I am Doa. I was born in a Middle Eastern country 19 years ago. I grew up in a nice small town with my family. My life was pretty ordinary until I realized that I was into feminine stuff, but thought it was a fetish and kept it to myself until 2019. I searched about gender dysphoria, transexual people etc. and I realized that I was possibly a trans woman. I asked my parents to see a psychiatrist, but did not tell the reason since I was not sure. After few appointments, both of us were sure that I was trans. Then, I came out to my parents, which was a disaster. They told me that I was a monster, threatened me with disowning me and stuff. Also, that was a shitty timing because it was my last year on high school and I was going to take an exam to apply universities. As you would expect, I was feeling terrible and got depressed. Thought about killing myself several times and planned it few times but did not do it. By that time, my dysphoria was also killing me and I was running away from mirrors and cameras. After my 18th birthday, things got a little bit better. My parents stopped dealing with me and I found that studying non-stop was a good way to run away from my problems. Few months later, my exam went pretty good and I got accepted to one of the best universities in the country, which gave me hope about life. I was thinking by myself ""okay, what can I lose by fighting a little bit more?"". That was a year ago. In the last year, things got even better I can say. Since my university was progressive, everyone was nice towards me, my parents were fully accepting and I even started to look in mirrors after 1.5 years of misery. Then I got rhinoplasty, completed the preparatory year and here I am. Now you might ask ""What are you complaining about?"". I mean, I feel like I should not complain. Even though that I have not got a feminine haircut and I wear nothing but joggers and hoodies, people call me ""miss"", I am lucky to have a family like that -especially when you consider that I live in Mddle East- and I am enrolled in a good university. My life seems pretty OK compared to LGBTQ+ around me. However, as the title suggests, I just do not know what I want. I focused on my transition too much that I have no idea other than that I want to be seen as how I feel inside. I just feel like lost? I do not know what I want to study. I do not know where I want to live. I do not know what I want to do for a living. Of course there are things that I know that I would like to do or to have. But most of them are unattainable as I cannot change the past. For the future, I just know that I want to be loved by someone who sees me as how I want to see myself, but I could not find anyone who shares the same feelings, thoughts and stuff with me. So, I am here, feeling all alone, living without a goal or anything. I do not want to feel this way. If I could be a different person, I promise you I would. Not because I want to but because that way maybe I could be a happier person. I do not really know what I want nor what to expect from life",Depression

However, when the pandemic hit everything in my life turned upside down. I lost friends, I lost family and I lost myself. For starters, I would go to the recruiting office every day, because my recruiter would call me fat and dumb if I did not show up. I remember specifically one day I gained 1 pound after losing 15 for her. And when she found out about that one pound she put me on a water diet where I only drink liquids. However this dinner because I gained some of the weight back. From that point on, I knew she starts to lose hope when I have seen her talk to my other friends about me. From there I caught Covid, and could not leave my bed for a whole month. And When I went back to the recruiting office, I saw more as a faker than a human being. Moving forward, from that point on we had a chat, and she told me straight up that I would not do anything good in my life, and she said that the army is the only good thing for me. That night I starved myself from June 25-29 hoping to get skinnier to show her that I was right. However, I found out the hard way, that it did not help but made my weight worse.

I have been on lamotrigine 3 months.

One day about 2 weeks ago, I woke up depressed, tired, slow, irritated, not caring about anything, etc etc…
Real depression, not a bad mood &amp; not hormonal! 
The depression came on so suddenly, like being hit by a depression-train.

It got worse every day, until I was snapping at colleagues, thinking about not being here etc.
Life was getting unmanageable. 

This kind of depression is nothing new to me, I expected it to last for months. 

On the 9th day, I woke up no longer depressed. 
Completely “normal”.

Is this sudden onset depression common?

51391,"I firmly believe undiagnosed ADHD is a big part of the reason why I have this disorder Beyond emotional (and sometimes physical) neglect, I always knew something was different about me. And not in a good way. I couldn't relate to my peers growing up and I could never figure out why. I was always ""too much"". Too loud, too weird, too emotional. I never had the same interests as the other kids around me. Which made me sad because I wanted to, but never did 

Then there's the fact that I couldn't catch on to jokes quickly, which made me awkward. My poor attention span and memory made things worse. Sometimes my teacher would ask me to do a favor (like grab something from a shelf) and I couldn't follow directions. This happened a lot growing up. People getting frustrated with me or thinking there's something wrong with me because I couldn't follow directions. 

This evolved into a massive fear of being embarrassed. If someone was telling me where to go, I'd need a visual. A map or for me to write down their directions, because I'll get lost. My short term memory is so bad. I remember my uncle was giving me his phone number (we were moving and he had to leave and come back but I needed to be in contact with him). 

He recited the numbers and I couldn't remember what he said quick enough. I just always felt like I'm slow to process things. I still am. Someone will state a fact about themselves, I'll look them in the face and nod like I was listening. But I wasn't, so I *repeat what they said back to them* and they all give me this ""wtf"" look and they tell me they just said that a moment ago. 

Sometimes I forget the things I myself said and it would lead to me repeating myself multiple times. Again, ending with people giving me this ""wtf is wrong with her?"" Look. Yikes. 

It doesn't help that I think I deal with rejection sensitive dysphoria. It takes *very little* for me to get flustered and embarrassed. It led to me lashing out at others as a child, which ofc led to me being excluded eventually. I always over-expressed my emotions and I think that was off putting to other people. When I was happy I was very happy. When I felt a twinge of sadness, I was crying, when I was mad I was yelling and name calling.

I had overall weird impulsive behavior. I would say the most random things and make really weird movements (I still do but only at home lol). I think all of these things just made others reject me because I was so strange. And to avoid the harsh judgement, I started masking all of my ""quirks"", but I lost myself in the process. 

I went from one extreme to the other. Instead of being overly expressive, I isolate myself and I come off as cold, uncaring, and stuck up. But this couldn't be further from the truth. I truly *do* care about people but I'm emotionally blocked off and still trying to mask those symptoms that make me seem ""weird""

48419,"I systematically throw up before having a Zoom meeting with my soon-to-be PHD supervisor Before anyone asks, no, the problem is not coming from my supervisor. He’s kind, willing to help and available for me. 

If you ask me I wouldn’t even say that I feel stressed before the meetings, in the sense that I’m not overthinking, I’m not having this bowl of stress in my belly that one could have facing pressure.

I really don’t know what can I do to stop this because it doesn’t feel like the problem is coming from me. It feels like I have no other choice but to throw up. 

Obviously it’s linked to the fact that I’m going to apply to a PhD and the fact that he’s a very knowledgeable man in his field, and there’s probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing. But what’s worrying me is the fact that of all the 10-12 meetings we had so far, I systematically throw up.

If all I had to do was draft I’d be okay with that.

I feel really lonely, unloved, unappreciated, and most of all empty and hallow. I feel like an empty she will of a person, who has no sense of self and has no interests/hobbies/passions about anything in life. Everyday is the same boring monotony, and I do not feel motivated or have the energy to change my routine because I am so unhappy with the way my life has turned out and the people around me. I had a relatively good and happy childhood, however things started to get worse as I became a teenager. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was in middle school, I come from an immigrant family with very conservative values, and I never able to get the help that I needed for it. I struggled a lot in school and had poor grades, which I think caused me to spiral into a deep depression/anxiety. I have been struggling since I was 12/13 and I am now 24. I have also suffered a lot of abuse at the hands of my family members and the trauma has completely shattered my self-esteem and self-worth, which further made the depression/anxiety I was experiencing, exponentially worse. I definitely think my toxic upbringing/environment and not getting help for my ADD made things worse for my mental health. I now work at a Fortune 100 tech company, and I constantly feel unworthy and that I do not deserve this amazing opportunity. I do not have the confidence, and upbeat personality all of my coworkers seem to have. I have no support system, no friends, no relatives, except my immediate family. I am surrounded by my coworkers who are all in relationships, have a solid friend group, relatives, etc. they are surrounded by all of the love and support in the world, while I feel like I have wasted my life due to my unfortunate situation and years of trauma and depression. I feel like the people around me are so much luckier, they had it easier and I know they will go far in life and their careers. I cry every night because I am so terrified of my future, I have no friends at all and feel like no one cares about me. Dying of loneliness. :( I want to move out and live on my own but I am scared and the depression has been making it hard to find the motivation to get things done. Most importantly, I want to stay away from the toxic and negative people in my life. I do not want to feel like there is no hope in my life, no bright future for me. I do not want the people or the circumstances in my life to define me or break me down. I know I deserved better! How can someone who has no interests or hobbies and is very depressed such as myself, connect with other people and make friends? I would like to make long-term meaningful friends not just acquaintances or superficial connections. Thank you for reading my post all the way through! :) Looking for support",Depression

21424,"Like you, I have suffered greatly during my 28 years of existence. I am posting this because I have finally unsubscribe to this subreddit. I am sure I am going to get conflicting opinions about this, but I think that this is an important thing to talk about.Since I have finally lifted myself out of depression, after many years pain and suffering, I find that seeing these posts in my feed make me feel sad. I do not want to feel sad anymore, not that anybody does, but I see that if I unsubscribe I will not have this daily dose of sadness in my life anymore.This is important to note because I think that this happens to more people than we tend to realize. Once somebody finally gets out of depression it would behoove them to distance themselves from negativity and sadness regardless of the pain and suffering of those enduring it.My point is this, one of the problems with depression and why it seems to be largely ignored or exploited for monetary gain, might just be that once people get out of it they stop engaging with the community because it makes them sad. It does not mean I am not going to continue to help people whenever I can because I will and I do. it is just something I have noticed that I think people might want to hear about.I wish you all the best of luck, my breakthrough was getting back together with one of my childhood friends who was around when I went through most of the childhood trauma that I endured. Being with him brought me right back to when I was being molested in my basement by a mutual friend of ours. It felt like I got struck by lightning. Hanging out with my friend and engaging in playing a video game that my molester used to play with us all the time seemed to somehow get my emotions to start functioning properly again. It felt like whoever I was, died in that basement at 13 years old. Like all of my emotions became stuck in time and unaccessible. My emotions are finally working again, and I do not think there would have been any chance of me recovering without them back. I am not quite sure how this works, but I am actively trying to duplicate my experience in those around me who are suffering. If anyone else has experienced anything like this I would greatly appreciate it if you would share your experience.I wish you all the best of luck. And I know how much it hurts. I never thought it was going to get better I was convinced I would end up offing myself before 30. I would encourage you to go and find the people that you were hanging around when you were young when the worst things in your childhood happened to you.

21510,"The pandemic has completely destroyed my will to live. I have lost interest in everything that I used to like and now actively hate a lot of them. I moved to a new city and have no friends. I have not seen anyone other than my parents in 16 months. I do not have any close friends who I can talk about my feelings to. I have a terrible relationship with my parents. They do not care that I am sad. I tried telling them about my feelings, I cried to them. My mom brushed them off and my dad threatened to beat me up in front of all my classmates. I feel left out of everything. My friends are making plans, hanging out, playing games. I am here struggling through a mountain of workload and suffocating. Toiling through 10 hrs of online classes everyday trying to keep my sanity safe. Everyone I have talked to reacts negatively whenever i try to talk about my feelings. My closest friend accused me of using them after I confessed to them that I am suicidal. I have no motivation to do or learn anything. There is no interest for anything left in me anymore. Everyone tells me that I am to blame for my problems. No one knows what I am going through. No one cares. My friends tell me that I have become bitter. I hate myself so much. I just want to die somehow. I do not want to kill myself. I am too scared to. Thousands of people die everyday, why cannot I be one of them? I feel so lonely. A lot of times I have dreams where I meet and hang out with people I love. I am so happy in them. Then I wake up and I am hit with reality that I will not ever be able to meet them again. I hate being alone.I do not think I have depression. I just wanted to post this somewhere because no fucking person is willing to listen and I am so sick of it. I hate it so much.

It sucks because I really love him. He's a great dog, eager to learn, about 4 months old. But my pets that I had before him come first, and rabbits can die of stress.

I have no pain associated with passing a stool at all which is slightly comforting I guess...

Shortly after the blood started showing up last year I took myself to the ER and explained what was happening, after getting a finger up my ass I was told it was most likely hemorrhoids.

25368,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for about 7months now. We both have mental illnesses and we both have depression. I have been going to therapy for 4 years now and I see clear results. My boyfriend has only now gotten help and he is in an extremely dark place right now. I am trying yo help him but I just do not know how. He has no motivation to do anything and he just seems so down. He does not talk to me about it. Everytime I ask how hes doing he says hes fine. And when I ask him, is he sure hes okay, he gets mad. I just do not understand why.He does not really do anything for this relationship, and I get it I truly do. But it just hurts me and I feel like I am falling back to depression because of this. He never texts me and when we see each other he does not really talk or doesny want to cuddle or anything. We usually just have sex and maybe eat in silence and then go to sleep. And I feel so selfish because my depression is getting very bad. So my question is how do I help him? Can I? What things should I say to him to reming him that I am here? How do I help my boyfriend?",Depression

I thought I will probably do it at the end of august, so a day before school starts again. but in july, i had some kind of energy boost and gotten a job for august. so now that the 'energy boost' is gone again, as it always goes, I will kill myself on august 1st, a day before my job starts. the last few days of my life I have spent playing ffxiv as i do not have any friends.i thought about jumping in front of a train, but I would feel terribly bad for the driver. would not really matter after I have died, but still, only i should suffer from my life. so i plan on hanging myself, I will only have to endure until i lose consciousness, right? even though i fail miserably at everything i try, i hope I will succeed this once.I am kind of ranting, i know, it is 2.52 a.m. and i have somehow developed insomnia in the last few months.

Then the week after that I will have to publicly humiliate myself and disappoint my family. After that I have a battery of medical tests to do to figure out what is wrong with me - all we know is its serious. I have a family that loves me and I have friends, but it is like we are not emotionally connected anymore. All they do is give me practical things to do to solve my situation. Tell me it is hard but I can get through it. How I am strong. Nobody seems to care about how I feel. I just told a friend I feel completely defeated and emotional unstable and a she had to say was you can do X, Y and Z then start therapy. When these people are emotional I am on the phone with them, helping them. Listening to them cry. Comforting them. With me it seems to be all business. Is this my punishment for never really being an emotionally open person? Is this also my fault? I have received people's pain over and over, yet because my voice is even over the phone it is all business? Do I have to cry to get affection? I just feel like being done with this. I used to never consider suicide because of the hurt it would because everyone but I do not even feel that way anymore.

It’s genetics - my family has tons of moles, but today I noticed 2 more on my stomach, or maybe 1 new mole and a weird red dot? It’s making me extremely anxious.  

2 weeks ago I was in and out of the hospital for some strep throat complications which has completely peaked my anxiety.  I’m only 19 and I’m indoors most of the time and have no family history of Melanoma, but I can’t help but freak out. 

They’re very tiny, one is small and brown but the other may not even be a mole? It’s the same size, but red and not raised. No pain or itching. It’s just making me paranoid.

My hypomanic episodes always start lightly - actually eating properly, cleaning the entire house, talking to people, etc. and people will “congratulate me” (“you finally got up/cleaned the mess you live in”) and are all happy that I’m somehow fine and cured now. 

Then it gets worse and I’ll start to get angry easily, hit stuff, yell at people over the smallest things, get drunk or high with anything close by. I’ll do illegal shit, steal stuff or try to harm myself either by relapsing, staying awake until passing out or straight up attempting suicide because why not. 
And everyone blames me for it. In their eyes I am choosing to destroy the supposed progress from my depressive episodes; “Why would you do that to yourself?” and “I thought you were doing better.” No, I’m fucking not.

It’s dumb I know it shouldn’t make me so angry but I hate that no one around me is capable of grasping the fact that I’ll always be sick- that it’s not something that will just leave.

Call the cops to ease your mind, no ones going to find me. Waste your time by telling you care when you do not, because I know when all seems good people do not care. Give me your reason that I am wrong to say such things. Say to me that you have been going through what I have been going through. People with double standards against me, that judge me ignorantly, deny it please, so you can feel better about yourself. I have had enough of every Christian with a double standard of love; you rather judge than get to know others. You do not know me, because you judge me. And I do not know you because I judge you. If you talk behind my back, you should grow up and talk face to face. But fuck that now, it is too late.So now, know me for the fucking piece of shit I am. I am a fool, I know nothing. But you are wise, discerned, you know many things. Tell me what ought to do. I am weak and broken. Yet you are strong.No more condescension. No more bullying. No more emotional abuse. For those who are wondering about Christianity, a lot of them are just broken imperfect people acting like they are perfect.They ignore fellow believer that struggles with depression. Some of them forgive you and cut you off, for something they did that they cannot see. Some them lie straight to your face saying that they care for you, and then go ignoring you. Some of them are your best friends, that say they are there for you; but then drop you like a stone when it gets too heavy. Some of them use you, and again for sake of their image, get rid of you, because you are brokenness is too much of a mess. Some of make falsehoods about you to justify what they say, when you really just need someone to talk to. Also I find it hard to believe that Christians would rather isolate you than love you.More than 5 years of wanting to kill myself. I cannot talk about it. People say I talk to much about it, shut me down. People say I should be happy, shut me down. People say I am not the only one, shut me down. Now I will not talk about it. Now, I will try to be happy. Oh now, I know I am not the only one. Tell me with your learned words, I am being unfair in my statements. Call me arrogant for saying these things for feeling this way. My heart has been filling up because I have been silenced by a hardened heart of people, and now it is spilling over. All I see is evil. Christians should not ignore someone who is struggling, we are supposed to represent Christ's love, but it seems these people get caught up in themselfs rather then share love. I am joining them, I am going to think about myself as I kill myself. No more Christains with double standards of love. People who are so focused on their image ethier online or in person; no more. Is too hard encourage others? Or is it just encouraging specific people you do not like? And again, for those who think I am always negative. You paint pictures that you want to see. Never hearing the broken. No more prejudice.Out of everything I cannot stand, the most is myself, so I am ending it. I am finding somewhere secluded. And it would be a shame to hear from me again after saying all this crap. I am making sure it is done. Also I do not want to be locked up, and go through the same thing that is making me type this.And for those thinking I am seeking attention, use your brain. Even if it is that, does not mean it is not a cry for help? But I have to prove to those who think like that. I am going to kill myself, do not worry. I could write book from this heart of pain and thought, so give me your wise words. Look at your heart and learn from yourself. This does not apply to everyone, but that does not mean by saying that, you are one the ones this does not apply too; judge for yourself; fucking look in the mirror and actually look. are not you wise? Or do you know that you know nothing? Both trains of thought gives you all the more reason to look at yourself.This is the only stage I am getting, my death. Let me make a splash, so you can forget about me. I am sorry I am unbearable, it is my fault that I am too much to bear. I am sorry I am annoying, it is my fault. Now with your knowledge, hear what I am actually saying. Fuck this rant for being stupid. I fucking do not deserve anything. Rape me with your words, and tell me how stupid I am between the lines, or something like that. This is sad. No one wants to truly die.

18148,"Any advices or suggestions how to proceed?My partner is going through a hell of a withdrawal. He used 10mg Lexapro for only one week and stopped cold turkey(due to poor amount of information available). Symptoms lasted for one month and he relapsed this time using 100mg Zolof for 11days and stopping again cold turkey. Now we are 4,5months in and he is suffering from terrible symptoms. Brain zaps, weight loss, anxiety, depression, blurry vision, bad hearing, hard to concentrate, muscle pain, cognitive impairment, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, sweating, impulsivity, head ache, agitation, lack of self-esteem.. some symptoms more visible during different times of the withdrawal. Doctor appointment led to a doctor assuming that the symptoms are caused by psychological reasons. She said there is nothing she can do.My partner's whole personality has pretty much changed. After 4months there was one flash of his usual self - feeling all good, so confident and relaxed for 10minutes. It gave a little bit hope for a while. And then he was gone, again. Not a single day feeling good.GABA has been helping his anxiety a little bit.

For a while I honestly thought I was getting better - I am taking my meds, managing my mood swings, and enjoying my time alone (mainly because I stayed away from forming friendships, expecting the cycle to happen all over again, e.g. losing friends and burning bridges during an episode).But then an ex-friend from the past messages me and is pretty much hell bent on bringing me down (Virgos can be vicious). Now I am just done having a cry fest for an hour and telling myself I am a horrible human being and just wanting to die.Sometimes, just sometimes, I wish I had a friend I could tell that I am suffering.

11431,"Sorry this is long but I have to get it out.I have a dissociation disorder and I struggle with attachment/abandonment issues. A couple years ago I ended up in the youth psych ward. I got discharged and sent to this place called Woods Homes. It was a residential program for youth who have pretty bad mental health issues. Long story short, I got really attached to a couple of the staff there and sometimes they would leave without saying goodbye. That would always break me but I kept going because my favourite staff (J) was still there. When it came time for me to be discharged J informed me that she was also leaving. That broke my heart in a million pieces. me and her did have a decent goodbye but it still hurt just as bad. AnywaysLast weekend was really rough. My mind was spiralling. I was in such an intense physical, emotional, mental pain. I just wanted it to stop.My mind was just going over things that happened at woods (good and bad) over and over and over. My memories are what hurt me. The good ones hurt the most because it makes me realize I am never going to have that again. I am never going to find another J. Never going to see them again.With all this on my mind I wanted to end it. There was not a point to living without them in my life anymore. So I made a plan. I have attempted before but I have never made a plan. At least not a serious, detailed plan. Basically it was death by cop. I have a BB gun that looks exactly like a real gun with no orange tip. My plan was to go to read my confidential files from woods, go to woods, make a scene, have the cops come, Id say what I wanted to then Id point the gun and walk towards them. Bang.That never happened unfortunately. I ended up breaking down and dissociating. I was on autopilot and I ended up picking up my belt and tightening it around my neck. Even if I wanted to, I could not stop it. I was seeing spots and my vision was fading. Then I heard my cat outside my room. His meow pulled me out of my dissociation enough for me to undo the belt. It stayed around my neck for about 45 mins while I laid back and just sobbed. All of that did not change my mind though. I still wanted to bad to die. But I was too exhausted to do anything about it. After all that I smoked a huge dab and went for a walk still dissociated. I was hearing shit all around me, people walking, loud bangs and people yelling. I was seeing little shadow animals running across the road. But it was 4am and I live in a small town where the streets are absolutely dead at night. Just paranoia I guess. I ended up sitting on the sidewalk and dissociated then fell asleep. I got home around 6:15am. It was really a nightmare I was trapped in. The next day I was very physically sick. Just from the exhaustion and all the emotions I was feeling. could not do anything. I reached out to someone I work with at a life skills program and she graciously changed my appointment to monday. I went and saw her and gave her all my writing. After reading it she recommended I go to the hospital. I went to ER and waited for a day and a half before I got transferred to a short stay crisis stabilization unit. that is where I am currently. Its not helpful. I have been doing the work. I have been making an effort. But the staff do not seem to think that my problem is as big as I say it is. Everytime I have gone to the hospital and tell them what is going on the staff always look at me like really? that is it? Okay then its very frustrating. And usually leads to me making a scene on purpose so that they take me seriously. But then that leads to getting restrained and being put in high observation and getting tackled and getting a needle in your ass so you sleep for two days I have been through all this before and it was just as useless then. The problem is.. when I go home I know I am going to go right back into that state and want to carry out my plan. I feel so lost and hopeless. Not sure what to do anymore.Anyways. Thanks for reading.

18691,"4 years ago I dropped 70 pounds by starving myself in relation to a depression and medication induced lack of appetite. When I saw the weight start to come off, I just kept it going. Very unhealthy way to do it, but I felt satisfied with myself for the first time ever. But over the last 3 years the weight has gradually started to come back with various influencing factors. Every time I have started the process to attempt to get healthy in a safe way, inevitably a new depressive episode hits and my ability to do simple tasks tanks and I am left in survival mode and not caring about what or how much I put into my body. I fear going home. I fear going back to school this semester for the simple reason that my primary instructor felt the need to point out my weight a few weeks ago. Now, I have not gained all of it back, but definitely a significant portion. And yet, why is that her business? Why should she point it out as if it had any bearing on my scholastic ability?Anyways, I guess I just wanted to get this out. I am finally in a decent place mentally after tanking in January. I have caught up on very old dishes, did my laundry, and generally cleaned, and decluttered my apartment. I have been grocery shopping and meal prepping for the past week and making commitments to physical activity by investing in equipment for my home and taking Karate lessons.I feel like I can do it, but I am impatient and the anxiety of the realistic timeline for results against the timeline for the return to university has me second guessing every moment. But every moment I keep choosing to take care of myself even if it does not show to anyone else. yet. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I hope you are taking care of yourselves and screw those around you who are unsupportive of your health and well-being. Which is worse: physical weight or weight of spirt?",Depression

15109,"Been dealing with depression and general lack of emotion for a huge part of my life. I am almost 30 still living with my parents live an above average comfortable life. Work a meaningless job where really I just do not have to do anything thoughtful. Quite frankly my life is not too crazy where I should be depressed, at least in my opinion. But recently I have been doing something a little different.I have just stopped caring but kind of in the opposite sense? I used to lay in bed and just lay there thinking I should do ""x"" I should do ""y"" and then I would feel guilty about not doing anything but laying there. But lately I have just been not telling myself to do ""x"" but just been doing it. And it is insanely weird not thinking about it because I try to organize my day accordingly and such but I am just pushing myself to do things without giving my mind a chance to say ""in a minute.""That constant nagging at the back of my head that says just lay down; is like that annoying guy that just keeps getting in the way. I am just trying to ignore him. I mean I still have some off days but just not giving my depression the attention it wants seems to help me so much.I read about the rule of one minute or something like that. If it is a task or chore that requires a little bit of time like ome minute just get up and do it with the idea that you will reward yourself with that laying down feeling after. I end up just getting momentum and doing more and more because I simply do not give myself the time to think after the task. Let me wash my plates, oh ok done, let fold the laundry, oh ok let me do my bed, oh ok let me etc. And it is crazy because I feel like life is about having little meaningless tasks to do to keep your mind preoccupied.

Then it was then I realized I was farming my own views and posting it on my ig story to make it seem to people like I was winning this is the honest truth. After then I decided I do not want to put on act I want to actually succeed make nice content so that people would actually watch so I started making COD VIDEOS they were not anything special but they got some attention by some I mean sometimes 20 sometimes a 100 and sometimes people would actually watch over a minute which is bad but I wanted anything I was good with anything at the moment. But then everything went down hill Id skip school work sometimes to upload a video and it would do terrible as in 2 views 0 views and that broke my soul but! I still did not quit. Now mind you I reached a hundred subs four months after I started in all honesty a lot came from sub for sub. So when I reached a hundred subs I made sure not to do sub for sub ever again as I had wanted to build a fan base on the way to the top! So from the end of may to the end of 2020 I was stuck in the hundreds video after video flopping. At this point its December I got into a huge fight with my brother so he took away everything he bought. But I wanted to succeed on YouTube so badly I spent my last money on new equipment I would drop videos all the time despite having school yet they would still flop but I still kept going. My little brother would break my headset Id buy a new one because I did not want to give up, My dad would take away my console Id still hold out hope my videos would floop Id still hold out hope. Now this is March 2021 college semester ends in a month so its hard to upload(getting less than 20 but still going!) now my little brother breaks my tv so there is no way we could play. So I go awhile without uploading but I was gaining subs tremendously the videos of kakarot I had dropped a year prior that flopped when I originally put them out were going crazy reaching thousands of thousands of views I gained a bunch of subs from there and now I am very close to 200 I decided to buy a tv following the end of the semester and grinded out the rest to 200. And ever since I gotTo 200 its been so hard its been a month since I got a video over ten views my little brother keepS breaking my headset and my idiotic self who is chasing this fake vision keepsBuying new equipment in hope that would id someday be big have a huge fan base and entertain people and make their day better. I do not want pity I do not want you to sub I just to know if I should keep going or should I accept its not meant to be Should I accept it or keep going",Depression
